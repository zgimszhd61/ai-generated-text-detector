{"article":"my introduction to research occurred in the summer of 1968 , when , as a third - year undergraduate student of biochemistry , i started to work with kai simons in the department of serology and bacteriology at the university of helsinki .\nthis would likely not have happened had he not been the older brother of my girlfriend , majlen , who is now my wife of 44 years . having recently returned from postdoctoral study at rockefeller university in new york ,\nas it turned out , kai and i were to work together for the next 13 years , and it was he who most strongly influenced my development as a scientist .\nwell - informed , enthusiastic , generous , thoughtful , forward - looking , and ambitious , he provided unlimited advice and support .\nthe sds  page system to separate denatured proteins according to molecular weight , which revolutionized work on proteins , was just making its debut .\nthe prevailing view was that membranes provided solid , rigid , waxy walls between compartments .\nthere was no commonly accepted model for their structure . while few doubted that phospholipids could spontaneously organize themselves as bilayers in water ,\nit was not generally accepted that bilayers represented the basic structure of cellular membranes ( stoeckenius and engelman , 1969 ) . nor was it clear where the proteins that make up half or more of the mass of most membranes were located . in one model ,\nthey were placed on each side of a lipid bilayer , attached to phospholipid head groups .\na competing model proposed that membranes were composed of lipoprotein complexes associated side by side , like bricks in a wall . for a while\n, it was even proposed that all membranes contained the same  structural protein ,  a hydrophobic miniprotein .\nnone of these models made much sense functionally , but this was of little concern in this early stage of membrane research .\nthat the lipid bilayer formed the basis of biological membranes and that membranes were fluid and dynamic became generally accepted in the early 1970s .\nnicolson in the well - known model that still dominates our thinking about biological membranes : a fluid lipid bilayer with proteins either embedded or adsorbed to the surface ( singer and nicolson , 1972 ) .\nthe realization that proteins integral to the bilayer are amphiphilic ( i.e. , that they have distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces ) and can span the bilayer was a huge step forward .\nit now became possible to employ a protein - based approach to known membrane functions , such as the controlled permeability observed for ions and other polar substances .\nthe fluidity of membranes made it possible to approach fusion and fission and many other phenomena more rationally .\nmy own work focused on the effect of detergents on membranes and lipid  protein interactions .\nbuilding on the existing surfactant and colloid literature and the work of charles tanford on thermodynamics of membranes and detergent binding to soluble proteins , my phd thesis presented a conceptual and practical framework for the use of detergents in the solubilization , delipidation , purification , biochemical analysis , and reconstitution of integral membrane proteins ( helenius and simons , 1975 ) .\nrepresented a phase transition from the detergent - saturated lipid bilayer to lipid - saturated mixed micelles .\nwhen enough detergent was added , the lipids that covered the hydrophobic surfaces of integral membrane proteins were replaced by a detergent micelle .\nthe membrane used in our solubilization studies was the envelope membrane of a simple animal virus , semliki forest virus ( sfv ) . because of its simplicity and homogeneity ,\nwe were introduced to sfv by leevi krinen , a virologist working one floor above us .\ntogether with ossi renkonen , a lipid and carbohydrate chemist , leevi was one of my most important coaches and mentors in these early years .\nthe work on the virus and its membrane opened the door to international science . in 1975 , kai simons , henrik garoff , hilkka virta ( kai 's technician for many years ) , and i joined the newly founded european molecular biology laboratory ( embl ) in heidelberg . for me , it was time to leave the detergents and all the sudsy solutions with which it was so hard to work .\nafter reading a review about virus receptors by karl lonberg - holm and lennart philipson ( lonberg - holm and philipson , 1974 ) , i decided to take on the mystery of host - cell entry using sfv , our household virus .\nthis meant that i had to learn something about cells , which we had previously viewed merely as a means to replicate viruses . using electron microscopy ,\njrgen kartenbeck , a cell biologist , friend , and collaborator for years to come , saw sfv in coated indentations of the plasma membrane and in a variety of cytoplasmic vacuoles .\nwe found that lysosomotropic weak bases , such as ammonium chloride , inhibited infection but did nothing to prevent endocytosis and accumulation of viruses in endocytic organelles .\nfortunately , young group leaders at embl , including bernhard dobberstein , daniel louvard , and graham warren , had been recruited to start a program in cell biology . from them , we learned new techniques , such as indirect immunofluorescence microscopy , and about what is now called membrane traffic .\nthe key to sfv entry into host cells turned out to be the drop in ph that the virus experiences in cytoplasmic vacuoles after clathrin - mediated endocytosis .\nan acid - induced conformational change converts the spike glycoproteins into efficient membrane fusion machines , and the viral envelope fuses with the limiting membrane of endocytic vacuoles from the inside , releasing the capsid into the cytosol ( helenius et al . , 1980a ) .\ntogether with jrgen kartenbeck , erik fries , kai simons , judith white , mark marsh , karl matlin , and others , i described how various viruses ( sfv , influenza virus , vesicular stomatitis virus , etc . ) took advantage of receptor - mediated endocytosis mechanisms and used low ph as the cue for penetration .\nin contrast with the secretory pathway , endocytosis had not received serious attention at this time .\nthe uptake of pathogens by phagocytosis in macrophages and amoebae was known , and fluid uptake ( pinocytosis ) had been described .\nit was found by ralph steinman and coworkers that membrane and fluid were continuously internalized , and the majority was recycled back to the plasma membrane .\nfurthermore , clathrin and coated vesicles were shown by keith porter , and later by richard anderson , michael brown , and joe goldstein , to serve as primary endocytic organelles for internalization of receptor - bound ligands .\nthis brought in the era of receptor - mediated endocytosis , and it was soon recognized that there was a pathway that not only served as a feeder to lysosomes but supported a variety of other interactions with the outside world .\nperhaps one of the most important observations emerging from the virus entry work was that coated vesicles did not ferry the viruses directly to lysosomes but to prelysosomal organelles .\nin other words , there existed intermediate , acidic organelles between the primary endocytic vesicles and the lysosomes .\nwe gave these organelles the generic name endosomes in anticipation of yet - to - be - discovered functions ( helenius et al .\ncell biologists studying receptor - mediated endocytosis of physiological ligands were also finding evidence for intermediate organelles .\nin particular , ann hubbard at yale and ira pastan at the national institutes of health , whose research groups studied the internalization of asialoglycoproteins and 2-macroglobulin , respectively , concluded that after uptake by clathrin - coated vesicles , ligands passed through electron - lucent vacuoles en route to lysosomes ( wall et al . , 1980 ; willingham et al . , 1980 ) .\nin 1981 , i moved to yale school of medicine , having been invited by george palade , another great mentor and role model , to join the section of cell biology .\nmy group included judith white , mark marsh , eva bolzau , and jennifer wellsteed from embl , and we continued to work on viruses , endosomes , and endocytosis - related topics .\nluckily , we were joined by ira mellman from rockefeller university , who had just joined the yale faculty .\nhe brought with him deep insights into the cell biology of endocytosis and membrane trafficking , and an invaluable spirit of enthusiasm and confidence .\nthe combined group made rapid progress on the role of early and late endosomes in molecular sorting and in virus entry .\nhaving been overshadowed by the more popular and more  populated  secretory pathway , the endocytic pathway established itself in the 1980s as the important and fascinating subject of study that it still is today . since then , i have worked with many excellent students and postdocs at yale and at eth zurich .\ntogether , we have entered new areas of research , including membrane fusion , protein folding , quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum , and glycobiology .\nafter several highly rewarding diversions , my current group is again focusing on virus entry and the role of endosomes , using new tools and new virus systems .\none basic premise has remained unchanged during all these years : we have relied on viruses to guide our work .\ntrusting that they understand cell biology better than we do , we simply follow their lead in the hope of exposing secrets buried deep inside cells .","abstract":" the fluid mosaic model for biological membranes was formulated 40 years ago . \n ten years later endosomes were discovered as important prelysosomal organelles . at the outset of my research career , \n i was fortunate to witness both these turning points in biochemistry and cell biology from close up , and to participate in some of the studies . in this short essay \n , i will describe how this came about , and also try to provide some background as to the general starting situation in those not so distant pioneering years of membrane biology .

(1992) identified 34 occupational exposures that occurred in united states during 1984-91 and were linked to transmission of hiv.(4 ) the number of occupational exposures since that time has surely risen; at a rate of one case per 100,000,000 exposures per year, many times more exposures now probably occur annually. (5 )\nthese experiences have shown that the most effective preventive measures to be taken by physicians working with hiv-infected patients are those directed at the protection of both doctors and patients. (6, 7, 8 ) because many of the cases of hiv transmission to physicians have occurred during therapeutic interactions, it seemed logical to develop the most effective preventive measures for occupational exposures in that setting. although it is known that latex gloves afford almost complete protection, their use has proven difficult to implement, particularly for doctors in small and medium-sized towns and for physicians in rural areas who must treat patients on a continuing basis with frequent changes in gloves and gowns.(8 ) these doctors and their patients often are not able to keep track of when a glove or gown worn during a procedure has been used. because latex products have a limited shelf-life in terms of hiv infection, the products need to be changed during each and every patient visit. as a result, many of those involved in the care of patients with hiv report that they are so preoccupied with protecting themselves and their staff that they no longer feel comfortable caring for patients. (9 )\nthese are reasons that physicians have long desired a more efficient and effective way of protecting themselves during such interactions with infected patients. to prevent infection with the human immuno-deficiency virus (hiv), a doctor who has had an exposure in the office or operating room must discard his clothes, including all footwear, disposable gloves, and surgical gown. (10) once removed, the discarded material is placed in a closed metal can for disposal. (11 )\nin 1990, a plastic alternative to these existing products was proposed as a single-use barrier system (sbxs) for the protection of health-care workers and the general public from the accidental transmission of hiv and other bloodborne pathogens. (12) the sbxs uses a lightweight sheet made of pliable plastic, coated with an adhesive on one side, and with a self-sealing, self-locking flap made of a transparent medical grade adhesive tape on the other. the"}

reported history of falling , doctor - diagnosed knee oa , and hrqol .\nwe found that self - reported history of falling and doctor - diagnosed knee oa were significantly associated with poorer quality of life according to the koos - qol subscale and the pcs of the sf-12 , after controlling for all covariates .\nwe used both disease - specific ( koos - qol subscale ) and generic ( sf-12 ) hrqol measures to capture different aspects of the health status of the study population.23 although a history of falling and knee oa were associated with poorer hrqol , the pcs domain of the sf-12 and the qol domain of the koos - qol subscale showed significantly lower score in persons with both conditions ( fall and knee oa ) compared with persons who had no history of falling or knee oa and persons with either a history of falling or knee oa .\nthe lower scores on the pcs and hrqol domains indicate a significant determinant worthy of further evaluation over a longer follow - up duration .\nwe had expected to find low psc scores on the sf-12 and on the koos - qol subscale when investigating how a history of falling and having knee oa affects these constructs at baseline . according to our data , individuals who had experienced falls and had knee oa showed lower mcs scores even after adjustment for sociodemographic , lifestyle , and clinical characteristics , compared to persons who had no history of falling or knee oa and persons with either a history of falling or knee oa .\nprevious research has identified adverse effects of falling and knee oa across different dimensions of hrqol , including mental health.24 for example , chen et al25 found that persons with a history of falling and knee oa had more comorbid mental health conditions and were at greater risk of anxiety and depression than those with neither a history of falling nor knee oa .\nour findings support the call for continued research on interventions that address self - reported fall and doctor diagnosed knee oa to improve hrqol.26 we can reduce falls by providing effective falls prevention programs for adults in our communities .\nthe centers for disease control and prevention has reviewed and identified community - based fall prevention interventions with strong scientific evidence of effectiveness.27 research has shown that arthritis conditions , including knee oa , have vast impact on quality of life.28 our study also confirms that having both conditions ( fall and knee oa ) are significantly associated with poorer hrqol compared with persons who had no history of falling or knee oa and persons with either a history of falling or knee oa .\nthe presence of knee oa has been shown to be a risk factor for falls.29 it makes sense that the presence of knee oa has the greatest impact on fall risk , and functional ability ( eg , gait , ability to rise from a chair ) shows direct associations with fall frequency.30 consistent with our findings , sturnieks et al found an increased risk of falls in adults with knee oa relative to a sample of healthy adults.31 our study has several strengths .\nto our knowledge , it is the first to examine hrqol in relation to self - reported falls and doctor - diagnosed knee oa .\nour data were obtained from the large publicly available osteoarthritis initiative database and we used well established and validated measurements of hrqol , ie , the sf-12 and the koos - qol subscale . examining the effects of falls on hrqol outcomes is unique and contributes to a broader understanding of falls prevention in older adults.27 the limitations of this study include its cross - sectional design , which prevents comparison of data over time .\nfurther , the self - reported nature of the key variables , ie , self - reported falling and doctor - diagnosed knee oa , and fall data being limited to a 12-month period limits the generalizability of the current findings .\nself - reported doctor - diagnosed knee oa was not verified clinically or radiologically , except for cases where the doctor had confirmed the diagnosis , which introduces a degree of bias and makes it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion .\neven with adjusting for confounding between groups , there are still likely to be many unmeasured confounders in this type of analysis .\na better understanding of the relationship between falls , knee oa , and hrqol is necessary to develop effective prevention and treatment programs.32 for example , if future longitudinal research confirms that persons with falls and knee oa have worse hrqol compared with persons who neither had experienced fall nor knee oa and either had experienced fall or knee oa , attention can be devoted to the types of educational and training materials that could assist them in reducing their risk of falling and knee oa .\nthis particularly important for persons who had both a history of falling and knee oa , some of whom will required information in a bilingual format.33,34\nwe found that persons who had experienced falls and had knee oa experienced poorer hrqol than those had no history of falling or knee oa and either a history of falling or knee oa\n. falls and knee oa were significantly associated with both a lower koos - qol subscale score and a lower pcs score on the sf-12 , even after adjusting for sociodemographic , lifestyle , and clinical factors .\nfuture population - based longitudinal research is necessary in order to examine how hrqol changes over time .\nthis research is particularly important in underserved groups , such as those who are at high risk of falling and have knee oa .","abstract":" backgroundthe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self -

Further, it is not known whether the effectiveness of these exercise programs improves over time.\n\nWe previously demonstrated that a 4-month aerobics intervention improves functional capacity, physical performance, and balance in a 2-h aerobic exercise class conducted twice a week.16 However, the impact of the intervention on the balance and physical function of participants over an 8-year period of follow-up has not been reported. We hypothesized that the physical function, balance, fear of falling, and fall rate of older adults who participated in the previous 4-month intervention, over time would improve by the 8-year follow-up.\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe study cohort was comprised of the participants in a cluster randomization trial of a 4-month exercise intervention described by Oei et al,16 conducted in the metropolitan area of Brisbane, Australia, between May and August of 2004. This trial used 1 of the 2 classes used in our previously published study.16 Thirty-five exercise participants completed questionnaires prior to and at the end of the study. In the intervention group, 20 exercise participants had at least 2 self-reported falls in the 6 months prior to enrollment, whereas 15 exercise participants had no falls during the same period. The baseline characteristics of the groups were compared with that of a separate cohort consisting of all exercise participants with no history of falls during the previous 6 months.16 Results showed no significant differences in age, education, or sex.\n\nIntervention\nA 4-month aerobic dance exercise program was conducted twice a week as a 2-h session. The class was conducted by a qualified dance instructor in a 120-m2 air-conditioned room"}
{"article":"traumatic dentoalveolar injuries occur frequently in children and adolescents , affecting teeth , their supporting structures and adjacent soft tissues and contributing to major psychosocial and economic problems.1 various studies conducted among different populations have reported prevalence rates for traumatic dental injuries to be between 4.9%37%.27 one of the most serious traumatic dental injuries is avulsion , in which one or more teeth are completely knocked out of their alveolar sockets.8 avulsions constitute 0.5%16% of all traumatic dental injuries to permanent anterior teeth910 and most often involves the maxillary central incisor.11 although avulsion may occur at any age , the most common age for avulsion of permanent dentition is between 812 years of age , a time when the loosely structured periodontal ligament surrounding erupting teeth provides only minimal resistance to an extrusive force.8 prompt and appropriate emergency management is exceedingly important for the best long - term prognosis of teeth affected by avulsion , especially in young children.12 ideally , an avulsed tooth should be immediately replanted in its socket in order to avoid further damage to the periodontal membrane.8 the prognosis of a replanted tooth depends on the period of time elapsed between trauma and replantation , the type and condition of storage medium , the stage of root formation and the presence of contamination.1 therefore , it is essential that the lay population , including parents , caretakers and teachers , who are among those most often present when an injury occurs , are aware of the appropriate methods for managing avulsion.13 although numerous studies have been conducted in different countries to evaluate parental knowledge and attitudes regarding avulsed permanent teeth,1,12,15,16 to the best of our knowledge , few studies have been conducted among turkish parents.17 therefore , this study aimed to investigate parental knowledge and attitudes regarding avulsed permanent teeth and their emergency treatment in children in samsun , turkey .\na total of 289 parents of children aged 612 years receiving care at the ondokuz mayis university pediatric dentistry clinic were included in the study .\nthe questionnaire was designed to collect data on demographic characteristics ( age , sex , educational level and number of children ) ; previous training in traumatic dental injury and treatment ; and knowledge of avulsed permanent teeth and their immediate emergency management .\ndata collected from the questionnaires was coded and statistical analysis performed using the software spss version 13.0 for windows ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) .\nchi - square tests were used to identify differences in responses for different variables , with the level of significance set at p=.05 .\nmore than half of participating parents ( 69.6% , n=201 ) were female and between age 3039 years ( 64.4% , n=186 ) .\nresponses to questions related to parents perceived knowledge and attitudes regarding traumatic dental injuries are given in table 2 .\nmost parents ( 74.7% ; n=216 ) reported that they had never received any information about traumatic dental injuries , although 19% ( n=55 ) of parents had obtained knowledge about traumatic dental injuries from a dentist . while the majority of parents ( 78.2% , n=226 ) felt they had inadequate information about traumatic dental injuries , 59.5% ( n=172 ) of the respondents said having information about traumatic dental injuries was very important .\nresponses to questions related to specific knowledge of emergency management of avulsed tooth injuries are given in table 3 .\nthe vast majority 90.7% ( n=262 ) of the respondents reported that they would not replant an avulsed tooth in its socket .\nwhen asked what type of media was best for storing an avulsed tooth until a dental professional could be reached , only 9% ( n=26 ) chose physiological media ( sterile saline , milk , saliva ) , whereas 67.1% ( n=194 ) chose non - physiological media ( tap water , ice storage , alcohol , dry storage ) and the remaining 23.9% ( n=69 ) of respondents said they did not know which storage media was best .\nonly 5.9% ( n=17 ) of respondents were able to identify the correct procedure for cleaning an avulsed tooth , whereas 71.6% ( n=207 ) were unable to provide any answer regarding how to clean an avulsed tooth . when asked where they would take their children in the event of a traumatic dental injury , 46.0% ( n=133 )\nmoreover , most parents ( 68.2% , n=197 ) knew the optimal length of time within which to seek professional help for an avulsed tooth .\nno statistically significant differences were found in the number of correct responses by age , sex , level of educational or number of children .\nthe prognosis for avulsed teeth is improved by prompt and appropriate treatment , which often depends upon the knowledge of non - professionals present at the site of an accident before professional dental care can be provided.8 given the many incidents that occur at home and school , parents and schoolteachers present in an emergency situation are fundamental to the provision of appropriate care to the injured child.18 although numerous studies have been conducted in various countries examining the knowledge levels of parents , caretakers , teachers and other school personnel ( nurses , coaches , etc . ) regarding correct emergency treatment of tooth avulsion,1,12,15,16,1921 very few studies in turkey have examined parental knowledge of the subject .\ntherefore , this study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of turkish parents regarding the emergency management of avulsed permanent teeth in children . in line with the findings of similar studies conducted in nigeria20 and singapore,19 the present study found parents have a low level of knowledge regarding the emergency treatment of tooth avulsion .\nthis can be explained by the fact that most parents had not received any information about traumatic dental injuries . in one positive\nfinding , parents indicated they were unsatisfied with their level of knowledge of dental trauma management and were interested in learning more . given that a lack of knowledge about emergency management procedures for avulsed teeth may severely affect the prognosis of an avulsed tooth , there is a clear need for educational campaigns to broaden the lay publics knowledge of emergency management procedures for avulsed teeth .\nas table 3 shows , very few respondents ( 9.3% ) said they would replant an avulsed tooth in the alveolar socket , which is in line with previous studies.20,21 few parents were able to identify the appropriate method for cleaning a dirty avulsed tooth prior to replantation , which is also in line with earlier studies.1,22 in the present study , nearly one - quarter of respondents stated that they would scrub a dirty avulsed tooth before replanting it in its socket , which , in fact , is known to severely decrease the chance of successful replantation .\ndespite the anxiety involved in seeking emergency care for an injured child , nearly half of the respondents stated that they would bring their child to the faculty of dentistry following a traumatic dental injury .\nthis may be explained by parents perceptions that an academic setting will provide more highly trained professional staff and more advanced technology than other types of facilities,1 which reflects two basic assumptions , namely , that the faculty of dentistry is prepared to handle this type of patient , and that a specialist will provide better care than a general dentist.23 studies of clinical outcomes of avulsed teeth have demonstrated that the longer the length of time elapsed between tooth avulsion and replantation , the greater the risk of replacement resorption and inflammatory root resorption.22 whereas appropriate replantation of an avulsed permanent tooth within 30 min has been shown to have a 90% chance of success,24 only a negligible chance ( 5% ) of long - term retention of an avulsed tooth exists if replantation occurs after 2 h.24 it is encouraging to note that 68.2% ( n=197 ) of the respondents knew that for optimal healing , professional help should be sought within 30 min . of a traumatic incident . parental knowledge on this\nsubject is comparable to that reported previously by zhao and gong.25 the ideal storage medium should be capable of preserving cell vitality , adherence and clonogenic capacity26 and should be readily available at the site of the accident or easily accessible.27 if the tooth is transferred to a liquid medium such as the patient s own saliva , milk or saline within the first 15 minutes following avulsion , it is likely that some of the cells in the periodontal ligament and cementum will survive and play a role in regeneration.28 in the present study , rather than physiological media , most respondents believed tap water , ice , alcohol , or dry storage to be the best storage medium , and only a few were able to correctly identify sterile saline , milk , or saliva as the best storage medium .\nregardless of the age , education level or other factors , parental knowledge of tooth avulsion management was found to be low .\nwhile the important epidemiologic findings from this study may serve as a warning , they also represent a useful source of information for the support of education and prevention strategies and reduction of the overall cost of emergency and rehabilitative treatment .\nconsidering that many traumatic dental injuries occur at home and at school , the participation of parents and schoolteachers in the emergency situation is fundamental to providing appropriate care to the injured child . within the limitations of the present study\n, parents were found to have a low level of knowledge regarding procedures to follow in an emergency related to tooth avulsion and replantation .\nknowledge of emergency treatment of avulsed teeth should be increased by providing educational and preventive programs .","abstract":" objective : the aim of this study was to examine parental knowledge and attitudes about avulsed permanent teeth and their emergency treatment in children.methods:a total of 289 parents of children aged 612 years receiving care at the ondokuz mayis university pediatric dentistry clinic were included in the study . \n questionnaires were used to collect data on parents demographic characteristics , previous training in traumatic dental injury and treatment and knowledge of avulsed permanent teeth and their emergency management . \n chi -

{"article":"dental caries constitutes a multifactorial disease with a complex origin where the acidogenicity of dental plaque as a consequence may affect dental hard tissues [ 13 ] .\na reduction in plaque ph occurs following the release of organic acids , primarily lactate , acetate , and propionate , by oral microorganisms as fermentation products .   over the years\n, different approaches have been designed intended to prevent this disease from occurring . apart from strengthening the tooth mineral using fluoride , pronounced changes in environmental factors such as diet , oral hygiene measures , and the use of antimicrobials\nhave been suggested in order to induce ecological shifts in biofilm composition [ 3 , 4 ] .\nthe latter are designed to inhibit the fermentation activity of cariogenic microorganisms , particularly those harboured in the oral biofilm , which will in turn determine a shift from a diseased to a healthy state .   several possible mechanisms by agents of this kind have been suggested .\nthey include the prevention of bacterial adhesion , a reduction in plaque formation , and interference with the bacterial metabolism .\nthe most commonly used antimicrobial agent is chlorhexidine , a bisbiguanid , with known strong antimicrobial activity , but xylitol , fluoride , and essential oils are also known to possess similar , albeit weaker , activity [ 7 , 8 ] .\nchemical components able to produce one or more of the actions on different kinds of biological activity have also been shown to be present in a number of foods [ 9 , 10 ] .\nthe presence of compounds with antibacterial activity on different pathogens , as well as antiadhesive activity and inhibitory activity on matrix formation , has been demonstrated by different food products .  \nwhen it comes to different food products and their constituents , interest has recently focused on an edible mushroom , shiitake ( lentinus edodes ) .\nthe extract from l. edodes has been studied in rats and an inhibitory effect on one of the virulence factors of streptococcus mutans has been demonstrated .\nthere are few reports related to the general antimicrobial effects of different compounds obtained from shiitake .\nan aqueous extract from l. edodes displayed high antimicrobial activity on food -

snf2 ) , while the active compound ( shiitake ) resulted in an intermediate position ( figure 1 ) . a statistically significant difference when comparing the ph values at the different time points\nwas found at 2  min between shiitake and placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . in the case of minimum ph\n, there was also a numerical difference between the three products , with a difference of 0.2 ph units between shiitake and placebo and the positive control , respectively ( ns ) .\nminor differences in plaque acidogenicity were found when evaluating the maximum ph decrease , as well as auc5.7 and auc6.2 .\nonly minor numerical differences in plaque acidogenicity were found when comparing the results for the four washout periods ( baseline and posttreatment ; ns ) .\nthere was no difference between shiitake and placebo in plaque protein mass , while the positive control ( amf - snf2 ) resulted in significantly less plaque protein than the test or placebo rinse ( p < 0.001 ) .\nno significant differences in plaque protein were found between the four washout periods . in the case of acta\n, there were no differences in the amount of protein from resting versus fermented plaque , except for the positive control washout period , where less protein was found in the resting plaque ( p < 0.01 ) .\nfor got , there was a tendency towards a generally somewhat lower protein content for the resting plaque ( ns ) .\nthe protein plaque content varied for the seven test periods and two conditions ( resting and fermented ) for got between 14.7  0.1 and 40.3  31.4  g and for acta between 30.3  23.5 and 81.2  65.3  g .\nsignificantly less protein was found for the positive control compared with the other two test products ( p < 0.001 ) ( acta ) .  \nthe profiles of acetate , lactate , and minor acids ( propionate , formate , succinate , and butyrate ) for the resting and fermented plaque gave similar values for got and acta ( figure 2 ) .\nthe highest values for all the test sessions were found for lactate for fermented plaque , with a larger variation for got compared with acta .\nthe rinse period of the positive control ( amf - snf2 ) resulted in significantly less lactate and acetate for fermented plaque compared with shiitake and placebo for got ( p < 0.01 ) .\nthe corresponding data for acta showed that the positive control period resulted in significantly less lactate and minor acids in fermented plaque compared with shiitake and placebo ( p < 0.001 ) .\na higher amount of minor acids was found in resting plaque after the shiitake rinse compared with the positive control for acta ( p < 0.01 ) , while no such effect was seen for got .\nall the microbial data are presented in table 1 . for salivary microorganisms in got ,\nno statistically significant differences were found for lactobacilli or mutans streptococci in saliva between the three test periods .\nrinsing with the positive control ( amf - snf2 ) resulted in a significantly lower number of oral streptococci ( p < 0.05 ) and total number of microorganisms ( p < 0.001 ) when compared with the shiitake rinse .\nthe lowest proportion of mutans streptococci in comparison to the total number of streptococci was found for shiitake ( ns ) .\nno significant differences were found for any of the groups of oral microorganisms or the proportion of bacteria when comparing baseline and posttreatment washout periods . for plaque samples from acta analysed by pcr assays ,\nneisseria subflava was the most predominant microorganism of all the tested organisms , followed by veillonella dispar and fusobacterium nucleatum .\nthere were significantly fewer microbial cells and individual organisms in the panel , apart from s. mutans counts in plaque samples collected after positive control than after shiitake or placebo periods ( p < 0.001 ) .\nthe shiitake mouth rinse reduced the proportion of n. subflava significantly compared with the placebo rinse ( p < 0.05 ) , while n. subflava and s. sanguinis were significantly reduced by the positive control compared with shiitake ( p < 0.01 ) .\nfor got , the three test periods resulted in the numerically lowest plaque scores ( ns ) , while the positive control resulted in significantly less plaque than shiitake and placebo ( p <\nsignificantly less plaque was found for got after the shiitake washout period compared with placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . for acta , significantly less plaque was found at the overall preexperimental baseline compared with the other three washout periods  ( p < 0.001 ) .\ntaste experience was , when marked from very poor to very good , described as significantly worse by the volunteers after the shiitake test period ( got 47.0  32.7 , acta 3.0  4.6 ; mean  sd ) compared to both the placebo ( got 62.4  22.4 , acta 59.2  21.5 ) and positive control ( got 70.6  18.9 , acta 54.9  25.6 ) ; rinses for both got and acta ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.001 ) .\nsimilar significant differences were found for duration of the taste , taste perception , and experienced rinsing time ( data not shown ) .\na significantly higher perception of sensitivity of the teeth after shiitake ( 36.2  27.2 ) compared to the positive control ( 19.6  27.7 ) and higher perception of staining after shiitake ( 24.8  27.2 ) in comparison to the placebo ( 12.1  18.8 ) rinse ( p < 0.05 ) was reported for acta .\nthe burning sensation of the mouth was also significantly higher after the shiitake ( got 27.4  28.6 , acta , 43.2  30.8 ) and placebo ( got 29.1  31.5 , acta 38.2  29.1 ) rinses compared to the positive control ( got 12.6  18.8 , acta 15.0  23.4 ) for both test series ( got p < 0.01 , acta p < 0.002 ) .\nthe scientific approach and study design of this paper are based on the results of previous studies performed within the nutrident project .\nthe study was planned as a consequence of the initial chemical characterization of the shiitake mushroom , evaluation of the fractions and subfractions of the shiitake mushroom , and further evaluation in different in vitro settings [ 16 , 25 ] . due to different technical limitations at each of the two centres ,\nhowever , the fact that the conclusions are based on the results from 30 and 35 volunteers from two international centres strengthens its scientific value .\nhowever , the additional inclusion criteria in got , where the subjects are known to have reduced their plaque ph by at least one ph unit after a sugar rinse , indicates that these subjects may have higher caries activity .\nthe possibility that the numerical variation seen between the two substudies may be a consequence of the selection of subjects can not , therefore , be ruled out . due to the above - mentioned factors ,\nthe main finding in this study is that rinsing twice daily with a natural food extract may reduce the metabolic activity of the dental biofilm .\nalthough not evaluated in the present study , a reduction of this kind may result in the long term in a lower degree of demineralisation .\nthis is supported by recent data where a subfraction of shiitake showed a strong inhibiting effect on dentine demineralisation when evaluated in an environment using saliva - derived microcosms .\nthere may be multiple explanations for the present findings of a change in the acidogenic potential of the biofilm .\nprevious work focusing on shiitake mushroom extract has demonstrated biological activity relevant to caries prevention [ 16 , 25 ] .\nthis includes mechanisms such as bactericidal activity against cariogenic microorganisms , the prevention of the coaggregation of cariogenic microorganisms , the induction of the detachment of cariogenic microorganisms from hydroxyapaite , and changes in cell surface hydrophobicity .   the antimicrobial , antiadhesive , and antiplaque properties of polyphenol - rich beverages have previously been demonstrated [ 26 , 27 ] .\nrecent studies have focused on the oral health variables of tea in particular , both when consumed naturally or when evaluating tea and cranberry in an in vitro or in vivo design [ 2831 ] .\nsimilar findings relating to the plaque - lowering potential have been found both after using both different sweeteners   and essential oils .  \nthe interpretation of the acid anion profiles of the resting and fermented plaque is complicated .\nalthough a corresponding pattern when comparing the data with the results from the plaque - ph measurements would have seemed logical , it was difficult to obtain a clear and consistent picture from the current data .\nactivity of the food compound that was tested , a poor cooperation of the subjects , or a weak experimental design .\nwhen evaluating the same low - molecular - weight fraction of the shiitake mushroom in an in vitro caries model , a stronger inhibitory effect on acid production potential was observed by one of the subfractions ( sf4 ) in comparison to the whole low - molecular - weight fraction .  \nmicrobiological analyses included both the total cell count and bacteria related to periodontal diseases , dental caries , and oral health . only minor differences in both\nthe salivary levels ( got ) and the plaque levels ( acta ) of oral microorganisms were found between the different visits .\nthe numerically lowest salivary number of mutans streptococci in comparison to the total number of streptococci was found for shiitake . for plaque microflora , significantly reduced proportions of microorganisms were only found for the gram - negative organism n. subflava when comparing the shiitake mouth rinse with placebo .\nthese findings are supported by a recent study in which 11 days of frequent mouth rinses with the same mushroom extract resulted in a reduced amount of plaque but a weaker effect on the decrease in total bacterial counts as well as some specific oral pathogens when compared with a placebo test period .  \nwhile got found a significant reduction in plaque score when comparing shiitake with placebo , no such difference was found for acta .\nhowever , a reduction in dental plaque deposition has also been found when evaluating the active compound against gingivitis- and periodontitis - related variables .\nthis finding is furthermore supported by previous studies in which inhibited plaque formation was found when using mouth rinses of oolong tea   and pomegranate . neither the mushroom extract nor the placebo was capable of reducing plaque formation to the same degree as chlorhexidine , an antimicrobial compound known to inhibit biofilm development and maturation .  \nthe subjects reported a less favourable outcome for the different questions related to taste for the shiitake extract mouth rinse .\nhowever , following the reported negative reaction to the taste of the shiitake mouth rinse by a large number of the volunteers , one can not exclude that this may have had a negative impact on compliance . as a consequence ,\nsome of the subjects may not have rinsed with the active compound according to instructions and that they may have rinsed their mouth with water shortly after using the active substance can not be excluded . in order to secure the regular use of potential future products , it is important that this aspect is also considered seriously , as this factor alone may determine whether or not an oral health product is used .\nfunctional foods have not been introduced in order to replace traditional caries - prevention strategies but instead to add another tool to offer patients at higher risk .\nthe positive finding of reduced plaque fermentation activity indicates that there is an opportunity to add one more strategy to the palette of preventive methods .\nit is not surprising that a stronger effect was found for this variable and that only a limited effect was found for several of the other variables .\nthe metabolic activity of the dental biofilm is the end result of a large number of biological and biochemical caries - related factors .\nas shown by previous laboratory work [ 16 , 25 ] , the active compounds of shiitake mushroom may exert multiple actions on different caries - related variables .\neven if the effect of each of them may appear weak , they may interfere in a positive way in the complex and diverse microbial community constituted by the biofilm .  \nthe limited effect on several dental biofilm properties seen in the present study may indicate that frequent exposure for a longer period is needed .\none important factor is believed to be the contact time between the active compound and the different oral properties . the repeated rinsing with 10 + 10  ml for 30 + 30  sec was used to diminish the dilution effect of saliva and to prolong the contact time of active compounds with the oral cavity .\nfor this reason , both further laboratory and clinical studies are needed in order to evaluate not least the effect of a longer exposure period or variations in the concentration of these naturally derived biologically active compounds .\nthe main finding of this study is that frequent mouth rinses with a natural food extract ( shiitake mushroom ) may reduce the metabolic activity of the dental biofilm .\nonly a limited effect on other dental plaque properties related to the caries disease was found and not to the same extent as the positive control .","abstract":" the main objective was to investigate whether low -

{"article":"the last two decades , the optical properties of single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) have gained a great deal of interest [ 1 - 3 ] .\nthe one - dimensional ( 1d ) nature of nanotubes offers unique properties to their excitonic spectrum with many revolutionary applications .\nmany experimental techniques such as raman scattering and electrical conductivity   have been employed for the investigation of optical and electronic properties of nanotubes with variable diameters and angle chilarities .\nrelaxation dynamics and nonlinear properties in these nanostructures are key issues in understanding and developing their optoelectronic properties .\nultrafast studies of carrier dynamics have been performed in swnts   reporting that this system has a dynamic response ( < 1 ps ) one order of magnitude slower than in graphite ( ~130 fs ) . when mixing the swnts with conjugated polymers , the donor \/ acceptor interfaces of polymer \/ nanotube act as dissociation heterojunctions for photoexcited excitons .\nthese bulk heterojunction structures are presently believed to be the best approach for organic photovoltaics   and the advantage of this photoinduced charge generation   is evident with the enhancement of photocurrent in organic solar cells .\nparticularly , -conjugated poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) has been of interest because of high carrier mobility , mechanical strength , thermal stability , and compatibility with fabrication process .\nhowever , the literature is lacking a comprehensive study of exciton and dissociated carrier ( polarons and electrons ) dynamics in these very promising composites for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications . in this letter ,\ntransient absorption measurements   with femtosecond resolution ( ~150 fs )   provides a means to investigate the ultrafast electron transfer from conjugated polymer to nanotubes and the involved radiative or nonradiative relaxations .\nwe resolve the relaxation of excitons and dissociated carriers in swnt \/ p3ht composites as a function of nanotube concentration .\nwe have found that carrier relaxation within the valence and conduction bands of p3ht is beyond our resolution time ( ~150 fs ) whereas the exciton dynamics have a double exponential relaxation .\nfurthermore , the electron  phonon interactions at the vibronic sidebands quench the radiative emission by introducing nonradiative relaxation channels .\nin addition , based on the observed ultrafast relaxation we present a comparison of swnts and -phenylc61-butyric acid methyl ester ( pcbm ) as mixture materials in the p3ht polymer matrix for their photovoltaic performance .\nthe utilized experimental technique in this work is a noncollinear super - continuum pump probe configuration in conjunction with a regenerative ti : sapphire amplifier system with 100 fs pulses at 800 nm .\nthis system amplifies the pulses to approximately 1 mj at a repetition rate of 1 khz .\nthe temporal resolution of our experimental setup over the entire probing wavelength range has been measured to be better than 150 fs .\nthe temporal variation in the optical absorption was monitored as a change in the reflectivity and transmission , which was a direct measure of the photo - excited carrier dynamics within the probing region . in this work ,\noptical pumping at a fluence of 2 mj \/ cm was used to excite the composites and determine their temporal behavior . here , we should point out that around this fluence nonlinear effects such as exciton \nexciton annihilation were not observed in our experimental studies . for the preparation of the samples in this work , p3ht ( 5 mg )\nwas dissolved in 10 ml of dichlorobenzene inside a quartz pot which was kept over a hot plate at medium temperature .\nthe initial volume of dichlorobenzene was noted and solvent was added if needed to replenish the evaporated amount .\none milligram of hipco swnts ( obtained from cni ) was separately dispersed in 40 ml of dichlorobenzene .\nhrem ( using a jeol 4000exii ) observations showed that the nanotube material was free from catalytic remnants and formed bundles containing of up to seven nanotubes each . according to current literature , the hipco swnts are 1\/3 metallic and 2\/3 semiconducting . we have not performed any additional purification .\nappropriate amounts of p3ht and swnts were mixed from solution and the composites were ultrasonically agitated so long as to reach a uniform solution .\nthe total mass of the deposited materials and the surface of the quartz substrates were kept the same to insure that the resulting films had similar thicknesses .\nthe dispersion of swnts in the composites was examined by hrem using the jeol 2000ex ii microscope and we did not notice any difference compared to the pure swnts .\nin addition , iv measurements revealed a percolation threshold of 0.75 wt.% which denotes good dispersion of the swnts in line with current bibliography .\n1 ) that upon increasing the nanotube concentration in our composites , the nanotubes form ropes and bundles with measured nanotube diameters about 1.4  0.1 nm . the effect of the swnts bundles formation on the optical excitonic transitions for pure swnts material has been experimentally studied .\nthe interactions between swnts in close proximity with one another , and the corresponding changes in their electronic structure , have received much attention [ 20 - 23 ] .\nin addition to the inherent interest in understanding interacting 1d systems , intertube interactions are of substantial technological importance because swnts naturally form bundles in typical syntheses   and bundling has the effect of both shifting and broadening the electronic transition energies .\nhigh resolution electron microscopy images of ( a ) pure swnts and ( b ) swnts dispersed in p3ht polymer ( swnt concentration 50% )\n2 , we present the optical absorption spectrum as a function of wavelength for the pure p3ht polymer and swnt \/ p3ht composites . it is obvious that the p3ht polymer absorbs in the visible spectra region depicting a singlet exciton transition ( 600 nm ) and two vibronic sidebands ( 520 and 560 nm , respectively ) . upon increasing the concentration of nanotubes , the absorbance of the composites decreases ( see the inset of fig .\noptical absorption measurements at room temperature of swnt \/ p3ht composites as a function of wavelength .\nthe inset shows the absorption peaks as a function of nanotube concentration at the singlet exciton transition and the vibronic sidebands the decrease in the p3ht absorption is most likely due to the fact that there is less p3ht in the sample ( 65% swnt means that only 35% of the sample is p3ht , and the total sample mass is kept constant ) . due to various interactions that exist between the two materials ( donor  acceptor system )\n3 , we present the experimental data of transient absorption for the pure p3ht polymer when it is excited by ultrashort laser pulses ( 150 fs ) at 400 nm . from these data , it is obvious that when we probe at resonant with the singlet exciton transition ( 600 nm ) we observe a pulse - width limited drop of absorption which is attributed to state filling by the coulomb - correlated electron \nthis pulse width limited fast drop suggests that the exciton relaxation within the valence and conduction bands of polymer is beyond our time resolution .\nthe first one is fast with a time constant < 1 ps and represents the fast relaxation of excitons with energies close to the separation between the gaussian - like higher occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lower unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) states .\nthe second decay can be described with a stretched exponential   and most likely corresponds to the radiative emission of the p3ht polymer .\nthe latter is more pronounced when we probe very close to resonant with the first or second vibronic sidebands ( see the curves of 550 and 500 nm in fig .\nthe fast relaxation remains approximately the same , but the second stretched decay becomes faster due to the enhanced coupling of electronic with vibrational states ( electron  phonon interactions ) .\nthis coupling quenches the radiative recombination opening nonradiative relaxation paths by transferring the energy to the lattice via phonons emission .\nnormalized transient absorption measurements for the pure p3ht polymer at probing wavelengths 500 , 550 , 600 , and 700 nm .\nthe arrow indicates the time where the signal becomes positive for probing wavelength of 500 nm .\nthe solid black line represents the mirror image of transient absorption signal with probing wavelength of 700 nm for comparison purposes in addition to monitoring state filling and the subsequent exciton relaxation , the probing beam may cause secondary re - excitations to energetically higher energy states .\nsecondary absorption probably is present at all probing wavelengths , but it is more pronounced at 550 nm , a wavelength close to the strong second vibronic sideband absorption ( see fig 2 ) .\nthe photoinduced absorption ( pa ) signal for delay times longer than 50 ps ( see 500 nm probing wavelength in fig .\nincreasing the probing wavelength to 700 nm the energy of the probing photons is less than the homo - lumo energy gap .\nsince the density of states follows a gaussian - like distribution there are states in the energy gap which result in weak absorption ( see fig . 2 , arrow ( 4 ) ) .\nfollowing excitation with the 400 nm laser pulse , we observe an increase in absorption at 700 nm ( 1.77 ev ) .\nthis means that we are re - exciting carriers from an energy level that is occupied after the absorption by the excitation photons .\nhowever , if we create a mirror image of the transient absorption at 700 nm with respect to the time delay axis , the resulting curve ( shown in fig .\n3 as a continuum black line throughout the data ) depict similar dynamics as the 600 nm transient absorption data .\nthis suggests that the 700 nm probe re - excites carriers between the lumo and a state 1.77 ( 700 nm ) above it ( for electrons ) .\nnanoengineered composites of semiconducting polymers offer opportunities to realize desirable different optical and electronic properties based on exciton energy transfer or dissociation phenomenon across the nano - interface between swnts and p3ht .\nfigure 4 shows the relaxation dynamics of composites when we probe at resonant with the singlet exciton transition of p3ht matrix ( 600 nm ) .\nit is apparent from these data that the donor \/ acceptor interfaces in composites enhance the dissociation of excitons across the heterojunctions .\nnormalized transient absorption measurements for the p3ht polymer , pure swnts , and swnt \/ p3ht composites at probing wavelength of 600 nm .\nthe inset shows the fast decay time as a function of nanotube concentration following the initial excitation by the 400 nm photons , the probing 600 nm beam monitors the population of excitons at the energy state located 2 ev above the homo . as the nanotube concentration increases ,\nwe propose that exciton dissociation is amplified at the nanotube - polymer bulk heterojunctions due to the presence of the inherent field at these junctions . from the experimental data in fig .\n4 , it is obvious that the nanotubes act as dissociation centers for the excitons minimizing the radiative recombination ( smaller stretched decay ) .\nthe variation in exciton dissociation efficiency can be represented numerically by plotting the fast decay time as a function of nanotube concentration in the inset of fig .\n, we note that this behavior remains the same for all the probing wavelengths used in this work .\nthe transient absorption signal of a pure carbon nanotube sample is also shown for comparison in fig .\nthe signal consists of two contributions : a fast negative transient lasting for a very short period of time and a positive contribution that lasts for the remaining of the measured delay time period .\nabsorption of the pump pulse ( 3.1 ev ) creates a population of excitonic states which gradually relax to lower energies before electrons and holes recombine . the fast recovery to positive absorption suggests subsequent secondary excitations by the 600 nm probing wavelength .\none can not be certain the starting ( base ) and final energy levels involved here , we can only be certain that the energy difference is about 2 ev . in the remaining of delay times\n, our transient provides an account of the decrease in the population of the base energy level of the re - excitation . a detail analysis of these two antagonistic contributions for a broad spectrum of probing wavelengths between 480 and 980 nm for pure swnts\n5 . ultrafast transient absorption measurements for pure swnts at probing wavelengths ranging between 480 and 980 nm . the inset shows a simple band diagram of carrier relaxation at the probing wavelength of 980 nm ( 1.26 ev ) , we only observe the photobleaching of excitonic states .\npa , however , does not become significant until the probing wavelength becomes 600 nm ( 2 ev ) where we observed delayed pa as described above .\ninterestingly , for probing wavelengths of 550 nm ( 2.25 ev ) or less , our signal is dominated by pa . as depicted by the simple mechanism depicted in the inset of fig .\n5 , pa between states with energy difference between 2 and 2.58 ev is very strong .\nthe dominant negative contribution at lower probing photon energies ( between 1.26 and 2 ev ) suggests the existence of an almost continuous density of states at these energies . when probing the same behavior in composites with high nanotube concentration ( 65 wt.% ) , fig .\n6 shows that the re - excitation at high probing energies ( see 550 and 600 nm ) is not reproduced .\nthe detection of excitonic state populations in swnts is therefore completely masked , except for the 700 nm ( 1.76 ev ) probing wavelength where we most likely see a contribution from the swnts and the polymer .\nthe initial drop in absorption is due to probing state filling in swnts , a trend obvious in fig .\nhowever , the polymer shows a strong pa contribution at 700 nm , a feature we have observed for all composites .\ntherefore , it is likely that pa contribution sets and overwhelms the negative contribution from the swnts absorption .\nnormalized ultrafast transient absorption for the highest concentration composite ( 65% swnts ) for probing wavelengths of 550 , 600 , and 700 nm , respectively .\nin conclusion , we have studied ultrafast transient absorption on p3ht \/ carbon nanotube composites up to 65% swnt concentration .\nlinear absorption measurements in these composites give an important insight of excitonic and vibronic sidebands .\nthe experimental transient absorption along with the optical absorption measurements reveal that state filling effect and pa take place in these composites .\nwe have found that carrier relaxation within the valence and conduction bands of p3ht is beyond our resolution time ( ~150 fs ) whereas the exciton dynamics have a double exponential relaxation .\nphonon interactions at the vibronic sidebands quench the radiative emission by introducing nonradiative relaxation channels .\nthe addition of nanotubes in these composites alters the relaxation dynamics of formed excitons dissociating these at short time scale and introducing new free - carrier relaxation paths for electrons and polarons through nanotubes and p3ht chains , respectively .\nexciton dissociation is accelerated with the concentration of carbon nanotubes strongly suggesting that dissociation takes place at the nanotube - polymer heterojunctions .\nfurthermore , even at high nanotube concentrations , the pump pulse is predominantly absorbed by the polymer albeit a strong influence by polymer - nanotube heterojunctions on transient absorption of the probe beam .\nthis behavior could be justified by comparing the absorption strength of both materials at 400 nm .\nfinally , it is well known in the filed of photovoltaic applications that solar cells based on swnt - p3ht composites do not work well , although swnt coatings might be useful as transparent electrodes .\nthe evidence in this work suggests that this failing of the swnts is not due to lack of exciton dissociation , since we observe shorter exciton lifetimes as the amount of swnt is increased .\nthis means that maybe other factors , like recombination of charge carriers in nanotubes or polymer chains , are responsible for their poorer performance in these photovoltaics . on the other hand , in preview work  \nwe have reported that pcbm - p3ht composites have also a fast exciton dissociation time which quenches the radiative recombination of the polarons \/ excitons , and increases the yield of photogenerated charged excitations from the pcbm - related states . with increasing the pcbm concentration in the blended materials in that work , we have observed that the relaxation times increase as opposed to the relaxation dynamics upon increasing the swnt concentration in the same p3ht matrix .\nwe believe that this important difference is responsible for the higher photovoltaic performance of pcbm - p3ht compared with the swnt - p3ht composite .\nthe work in this article was partially supported by the research programs eryan\/0506\/04 and eryne\/0506\/02 funded by the cyprus research promotion foundation in cyprus .","abstract":" femtosecond transient absorption measurements on single wall carbon nanotube \/ poly(3-hexylthiophene ) composites are used to investigate the relaxation dynamics of this blended material . \n the influence of the addition of nanotubes in polymer matrix on the ultrashort relaxation dynamics is examined in detail . \n the introduction of nanotube \/ polymer heterojunctions enhances the exciton dissociation and quenches the radiative recombination of composites . \n the relaxation dynamics of these composites are compared with the fullerene derivative -

{"article":"breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer mortality in the united states and texas .\nit is estimated that 207,090 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,840 breast cancer deaths occurred among women in the usa during 2010 .\nthere is considerable variation in the rates of breast cancer mortality at the county level .\nthe reported highest and lowest age - adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer from 2000 to 2008 for texas at the county level were 41.9 and 16.1 per 100,000 , respectively .\napart from geographical variation in breast cancer mortality , there is a significant disparity in breast cancer mortality in texas based on racial and ethnic status .\nmortality rates for female breast cancer were approximately 30% higher during 19922001   and 50% higher during 20012005   among black women compared to white women .\nboth black and hispanic women were found to have significantly increased relative risk of breast cancer mortality compared to non - hispanic white women during 19922000 [ 3 , 5 ] .\nrelatively few studies have been conducted to examine how racial and ethnic status affects the geographic distribution of breast cancer mortality , and no study has been conducted to investigate this at the county level in the state of texas .\nidentification of geographic patterns of breast cancer mortality based on racial and ethnic status could provide impetus to conduct further investigations and target health resources for prevention and treatment in specific geographic areas . the spatial scan statistic method developed by kulldorff , kulldorff and nagarwalla  \nhas been shown to be an effective method for investigating geographical patterns of cancer and detecting spatial cancer clusters .\na cancer cluster is defined as a greater - than - expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a specified period of time .   a previous study published by zhan and lin in 2003   detected two statistically significant clusters of female breast cancer mortality at the county level using data provided by the bureau of vital statistics of the texas department of health for the period from 1990 to 1997 . the most likely cluster identified ( p value 0.0004 )\naransas , atascosa , austin , bastrop , bee , bexar , brazoria , brooks , caldwell ,

paper , we present results of spatial analyses using the spatial scan statistic method on female breast cancer in the state of texas using county - level female breast cancer mortality data for the years 2000 to 2008 .\nthe objectives of the study were to detect high - risk areas of breast cancer mortality through the discrete poisson model , investigate whether there are high - risk areas where the distribution of breast cancer mortality differs based on the racial \/ ethnic status of the population using the multinomial model , and examine the spatial distribution of breast cancer mortality cases for non - hispanic blacks ( nhbs ) , hispanics and other races compared to non - hispanic whites ( nhws ) using the bernoulli model .\nthe case definition for this study was a death due to malignant neoplasm of breast cancer ( c50 ) as listed by the international classification of diseases , 10th revision ( icd-10 ) in the female population of texas for the years 2000 to 2008 .\nthe breast cancer mortality data at the county level for the years 2000 to 2008 were obtained from the texas cancer registry , cancer epidemiology and surveillance branch , texas department of state health services .\nthe texas cancer registry classifies cancer mortality data according to the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results ( seer )  cause of death recode \n, as given by the seer cause of death recode 1969 + ( 9\/17\/2004 ) ( http:\/\/seer.cancer.gov\/codrecode\/1969+_d09172004\/index.html ) , and the seer program has defined major site groups based on the icd-10 .\nthe texas cancer registry is a statewide , population - based registry that collects high - quality , population - based data reported from various sources , including hospitals , cancer treatment centers , ambulatory surgery centers , pathology laboratories , and physician 's offices through active and passive surveillance .\nit currently meets standards set by the national program of central cancer registries , centers for disease control and prevention for high - quality data , and is gold - certified by the north american association of central cancer registries . in all , 22,820 breast cancer deaths occurred in texas between the years 2000 to 2008 , of which 15,234 ( 66.8% ) were attributed to nhw , 3,503 ( 15.4% ) to nhb , and 3,770 ( 16.5% ) to hispanics . at\n- risk population data at the county level for texas covering the same time period were obtained from the us census bureau .\ngeographic coordinate data ( i.e. , county centroids ) that represent the locations of the 254 texas county polygons were specified by the 2000  us bureau of the census .\nwe ran purely spatial analyses using 4 different models ( discrete poisson with and without covariates , bernoulli and multinomial models ) .\nfor the discrete poisson model , we assumed that the number of deaths in each county was poisson distributed and ran the model with and without adjustment of racial \/ ethnic status of the population . for the bernoulli model , we classified breast cancer deaths among nhw as controls and breast cancer deaths among other racial \/ ethnic groups as cases , thereby creating 3 comparisons ( nhb versus nhw , hispanics versus nhw and  other races  versus nhw ) .\nfor the multinomial model , we classified breast cancer deaths into 4 racial \/ ethnic categories ( nhw , nhb , hispanics , and other races ) .\nwe used the satscan v9.1.1 released on march 9 , 2011 to run the spatial scan statistics .\nthe spatial scan statistics detect high - risk areas of cases by gradually scanning a window across space and noting the number of observed and expected observations inside the window .\nthe window sizes are varied continuously up to a prespecified maximum size . the most likely cluster ( the cluster least likely to be due to chance ) is assigned to a window with the maximum likelihood .\nwe used the scanning window in the shape of a circle and specified the maximum window size as one that included 50% of the at - risk population throughout our analyses .\nwe also report secondary clusters that cause a rejection of the null hypothesis ( i.e. , the log likelihood ratio of secondary clusters in the real data is higher than that of the most likely cluster in the simulated data sets ) and do not overlap the most likely cluster .\nmapinfo professional version 8.0 was used to create the thematic map based on detected counties by spatial scan statistics .\nthis study did not need to be approved by the committee for the protection of human subjects because it used aggregated data on county - level breast cancer mortality in texas .\nresults of spatial analysis using the discrete poisson model without any covariate adjustment suggests that there were five statistically significant clusters of counties with a high rate of female breast cancer mortality in texas for the years 2000 to 2008 ( table 1(a ) , figure 1(a ) ) .\nthe most likely cluster was located in the northeast corner of texas , including 51 counties with relative risk of 1.27 compared to the rest of texas .\nsecondary clusters were located in the central region of texas ; the southeast central region ; the northern part of the state ; the region inclusive of bosque , hood and somervell counties .\ncorresponding relative risks were 1.57 , 1.38 , 1.13 , and 1.66 , respectively , compared to the rest of texas . after adjusting for racial \/ ethnic status of the population , spatial analysis using the discrete poisson model detected two statistically significant clusters ( table 1(b ) , figure 1(b ) ) .\nthe most likely cluster was located in the western and central region of texas , including 106 counties with relative risk of 1.23 compared to the rest of the state .\na secondary cluster was located in southeastern texas with relative risk of 1.32 compared to the rest of texas .\nresults of spatial analysis using the multinomial model suggest that there were three statistically significant clusters of counties where the distribution of risk for female breast cancer mortality based on race \/ ethnicity is statistically significantly different from the remaining regions of texas ( table 2 , figure 1(c ) ) .\nthe most likely cluster was located in south texas where hispanics had the highest risk and nhb had the lowest risk .\nthe risk of female breast cancer mortality was 4.77 times higher among hispanics and 0.29 times lower among nhb in the cluster compared to the rest of texas .\nthe first secondary cluster was located in northeast texas where nhb had the highest risk and hispanics had the lowest .\nthe risk of female breast cancer mortality was 3.42 times higher among nhb and 0.31 times lower among hispanics in this cluster compared to the rest of texas .\nthe other secondary cluster was located in the northern and western region of texas , where nhw had the highest risk and hispanics had the lowest , although the risk of female breast cancer mortality for one group is not substantially different from the other groups . \n\ntable 3 shows results of spatial analysis using the bernoulli model for nhb , hispanics , and other races compared to nhw .\nfor nhb versus nhw , we detected one significant cluster located in the northeastern region of texas , with relative risk of 2.63 compared to the rest of the state ( figure 1(d ) ) .\nfor hispanics versus nhw , we detected two significant clusters ( figure 1(e ) ) .\nthe most likely cluster was located in the extreme southern region of texas with relative risk of 4.13 compared to the rest of texas , and the secondary cluster was located in the western region of texas with relative risk of 3.83 compared to the rest of the state . for  other races  versus nhw , we detected two significant clusters ( figure 1(e ) ) .\nthe most likely cluster included four counties ( brazoria , fort bend , harris , and waller ) in southeast texas , with relative risk of 2.77 , and the secondary cluster included four counties ( collin , dallas , denton , and tarrant ) in northeast texas , with relative risk of 1.70 compared to the rest of the state .\nwe found several statistically significant clusters for female breast cancer mortality at the county level in texas through purely spatial analyses .\nfive significant clusters were found through the discrete poisson model without any covariate adjustment , while the same model after adjusting for racial \/ ethnic status detected two significant clusters with different geographic distributions .\nthe multinomial model detected three significant clusters with different distributions of risk based on racial \/ ethnic status .\nthe bernoulli model found one significant cluster for nhb versus nhw , while two significant clusters were detected for hispanics versus nhw and another two for  other races  versus nhw .\nzhan and lin ( 2003 ) conducted spatial cluster analysis using the discrete poisson model without any covariate adjustment on female breast cancer mortality data for the years 1990 to 1997 and found two significant clusters .\nthe most likely cluster was located in the southeast region of texas and the secondary cluster included only one county : el paso .\nwe found five significant clusters using the same analysis for the years 2000 to 2008 .\nthe most likely cluster in our findings was located in the northeast region of texas , and three secondary clusters were located in the northern and central regions of the state . only one secondary cluster located in southeast texas had overlapped with the most likely cluster found by zhan and lin ( 2003 ) .\nthis indicates that the geographic distribution of female breast cancer mortality at the county level has shifted over time from the southeast towards northern and eastern areas in texas .\none explanation for this change could be rapid growth of urban areas and slower growth of rural areas in texas during the same period .\nin fact , texas is one of the top five fastest growing states with a 20.6% and 4.3 million ( highest numeric increase ) population increase between 2000 and 2010 .\nabout 85% of the total texas population resided in urban areas in 2005 , with most concentrated in the six largest metropolitan statistical areas  austin - san marcos , dallas , fort worth , el paso , houston , and san antonio .\nhouston and dallas - fort worth were among the top 3 fastest growing metro areas of the ten most populous metro areas in the unites states .\ntogether , they accounted for almost one - half of the state population and its population growth between 2000 and 2010 .\nhispanics are the fastest growing population in texas and are expected to outnumber whites by 2020 .\nthis shift in population demographics presents challenges for effective distribution of health care resources to reduce the disparities for breast cancer mortality .\nafter adjusting for racial and ethnic status , the location of the most likely cluster changed from the northeast to the western area of texas .\nthis indicates that the existence of clusters in northeast texas could be explained by racial and ethnic disparities in the region , while other etiological factors might explain mortality clusters in west texas .\nwe found three significant clusters using multinomial analysis where risk for breast cancer mortality differed based on racial \/ ethnic status .\nthe cluster in the northeast area of texas had significantly highest risk for nhb and lowest risk of hispanics , while the cluster in the southern area of texas had significantly highest risk for hispanics and lowest risk for nhb .\nit is important to note that risk is not substantially different among racial \/ ethnic groups in the northern texas cluster .\nfindings from the bernoulli model analysis support the results of the multinomial analysis , indicating that breast cancer mortality is heterogeneously distributed based on racial \/ ethnic status .  \nnhb and hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with later stages of breast cancer [ 1113 ] and have relatively higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared to nhw [ 3 , 5 ] .\nsocioeconomic status ( ses ) of the population is an important predictor of stage of breast cancer at diagnosis .\nless utilization of mammography facilities , cancer radiotherapy , and cancer surgery among minorities is the likely reason that they tend to be diagnosed at later stages and have higher mortality from breast cancer [ 1517 ] .\nhispanics were the majority in 34 texas counties in the usa - mexico border region , and health care , including preventive and therapeutic resources , are more likely to be scarce or lacking in this underserved population [ 19 , 20 ] .\nall of these factors could help explain why the highest risks for nhb were in the northeast , and highest risks for hispanics were in the southern areas of texas .\nthe lower risks for other racial \/ ethnic groups are the result of unknown factors .\nwe identified one cluster in northeast texas that had higher risk of breast cancer mortality for nhb compared to nhw though the bernoulli model analysis .\nthe location of this cluster was the same as that found by the multinomial analysis ; however , the risk was slightly lower\n. this could be due to fact that we included other races in the multinomial model analysis and breast cancer incidence and mortality have been observed to be lower among this group compared to nhw , nhb , and hispanics .\nfor example , cancer incidence and mortality per 100,000 were 51.7 and 8.6 , respectively , among asian \/ pacific islanders for the years 2001 to 2005 , while these same rates were 125.4 and 24.3 among nhw , 116.2 and 35.6 among nhb , and 84.6 and 17.2 among hispanics .\nusing bernouli model analysis , we identified two clusters , one in the western part of the state and another along the border with mexico , where hispanics had significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared to nhw .\nthe most likely cluster was the same as that found by the multinomial analysis ; however , the risk was slightly lower . for  other races , \ntwo significant clusters were detected , with each covering four counties around the houston and dallas metropolitan areas , respectively .\nthis might be related to the fact that the proportion of total population for other races in houston was higher compared to dallas .\nthis type of cluster analysis at the county level can provide useful information to policy makers for the following reasons .\nthe department of state health services divides all texas counties into health service regions ( hsrs ) , identified numerically from 1 to 11 , to provide comprehensive public health services to the citizens of texas through 8 regional public health offices ( figure 2 ) .\nin addition , public health services in texas are also provided through local health departments .\nbut only one - fourth of counties in texas have local health departments and most of them are located in urban areas .\nresults of our study could be important to regional public health offices and local health departments for establishing priorities and making strategic decisions about distribution of services for breast cancer .\nfor example , secondary cancer cluster 2 identified through the multinomial model ( figure 1(c ) ) covers hsrs 1 , 2\/3 and 9\/10 and very few counties in these regions are covered through local health departments ( figure 2 ) .\nregional offices could utilize their limited resources to provide screening services for breast cancer in areas not covered by local health departments .\nmoreover , our results also indicate racial disparities in cluster identification that might be useful to regional and local health departments .\nfor example , the most likely cluster identified through the multinomial model ( figure 1(c ) ) had highest risk for hispanics .\nregional and local health departments could utilize this information to direct their resources for screening and education to this population .\napproximately half of texas counties did not have accredited permanent mammography facilities in 2008 as reported in the texas cancer facts & figures , 2008 .\nmoreover , most of counties with more than 1 accredited facility are located around the largest metro areas ( figure 3 ) . though the majority of the texas population is concentrated in these areas , our findings\nfor example , on - site or mobile mammography facilities with more multilingual and follow - up supports could be introduced in the southern areas of texas along the border with mexico , where we identified a cancer cluster with significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality among hispanics compared to nhw ( figure 1(e ) ) .\nresults of our spatial analyses at the county level provide useful information to guide future spatial analyses at finer scales in texas .\nmoreover , they are useful jumping - off points to conduct subcluster analyses at the county level or finer scales for a particular population group . for example\n, the census block or tract level analysis of female breast cancer mortality among nhb could be conducted in the hsrs 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 covering secondary cluster 2 identified through the multinomial model ( figure 1(c ) ) to identify high risk areas for that particular population .\nwe used breast cancer mortality data aggregated at the county level , which could affect the sensitivity of cluster detection .\nthe geographic distribution of total population and number of breast cancer mortality cases at the county level in texas is heterogeneous , with some counties having much lower mortality than other counties .\nlack of significance for some secondary clusters might be due to this reason or it might be due to the fact that the test is conservative , that is , we compared secondary clusters with the most likely cluster from the simulated datasets .\nresults may not be comparative to other studies using data aggregated at different geographic scales .\nalso , we included only race \/ ethnicity as a confounder in our analyses , yet there are many other known or hypothesized risk factors for breast cancer that we did not analyze , such as age at diagnosis , family history , alcohol consumption , access to mammography and other health care facilities [ 27 , 28 ] and various environmental [ 29 , 30 ] and reproductive factors [ 31 , 32 ] .\nresults of our analyses indicate that breast cancer mortality at the county level in texas is distributed heterogeneously based on racial \/ ethnic status .\nthe evidence suggests that highest rates of female breast cancer mortality have shifted over time from southeastern areas towards northern and eastern areas of the state . in texas , nhb had highest risk for breast cancer mortality in the northeastern region and lowest risk in the southern region , while hispanics had highest risk in the southern region along the border with mexico and lowest risk in the northeastern region . these findings , along with continuing trends toward urbanization , growing numbers of hispanic residents , and increasing levels of poverty for many minorities , provide challenges and opportunities for texas policy makers and health advocates .\nmore research is needed to make informed decisions about effective and efficient distribution of health care resources to reduce breast cancer disparities for texas residents .","abstract":" \n

touch  technique and incisional negative pressure wound therapy for pilon fractures .\npatients were examined clinically at 2 - 3 weeks and then 8 weeks for complications associated with the surgical technique .\nall fractures were ao \/ ota ( orthopaedic trauma association ) type c fractures ( 61% c3 , 22% c2 and 16% c1 ) .\nthe strategy of soft tissue control for treatment of pilon fractures resulted in relatively low incidence of early wound complications in patients with complex pilon fractures .\npilon fractures are among the most serious fractures that involve the ankle joint and continue to present a challenge to the orthopedic surgeon .\nthey are often the result of violent trauma and are associated with significant soft tissue damage , osseous comminution and articular surface disruption .\nmanagement principles were originally outlined by redi and allgwer1 and included reconstruction of the fibula as well as the articular surface of the tibia .\nthe subsequent literature initially revealed high soft tissue complication rates when using these techniques and principles in high - energy injuries.23456 current opinion is that the high rates of infection and wound healing problems may be secondary to operating through swollen , compromised soft tissues .\nthis has led to a staged approach to management for high - energy pilon fractures with initial restoration of fibular length and tibial external fixation followed by delayed open reduction internal fixation of the tibia when soft tissue swelling subsides.7891011 in addition to using a staged protocol for high - energy injuries , meticulous handling of soft tissues is mandatory to minimize soft tissue complications.611 careful attention must be directed to soft tissue retraction and wound management .\nwe recommend the staged protocol , anterolateral approach to the distal tibia , the  no - touch  technique where there is no retractor placed in the soft tissues yet adequate visualization is present to permit reduction of the fracture and applying incisional negative pressure wound therapy ( npwt ) , which we called  soft tissue control ,  for treatment the complex pilon fractures .\nthe purpose of this study was to evaluate the early rate of complications with using the strategy of  soft tissue control  for operative treatment of complex pilon fractures .\n36 close pilon fractures were treated with the two stage protocol at our institution between february 2008 and february 2011 .\nthe interval between injury and presentation ranged from 1 h to 24 h ( average , 6.7 h ) .\npatients eligible for inclusion were between ages 18 and 65 years with closed pilon fractures ota ( orthopaedic trauma association ) 43c .\npatients were excluded if they had a chronic disorder of their soft tissues , since this study evaluated soft tissue outcomes .\nthe mechanisms of injury were high - energy falls ( n=21 ) , motor vehicle accidents ( n=11 ) , crushing injury ( n=4 ) .\nthe fractures were classified according to the ao \/ asif ( association for the study of internal fixation ) system : 6 were classified as type c1 , 8 type c2 and 22 type c3 .\nafter the initial evaluation in the emergency department , the limb was pulled out to length and placed in a well padded splint .\nas soon as the patient was medically cleared , he or she was brought to the operating room .\nimmediate open reduction and internal fixation of fibular fracture with wound closure was performed . the fibula posterolateral approach at least 6 cm away from the planned anterolateral pilon incision ,\nif radiographs revealed a pilon fracture with an associated fracture of the posterior malleolus that was displaced , a posterolateral incision was made midway between the posterior border of the fibula and lateral aspect of the achilles tendon .\nthe posterolateral approach gave excellent visualization of the posterior aspect of the tibia and posterior malleolar fragment as well as the fibula without creating extensive surgical flaps.12 through the same incision , open reduction and internal fixation ( orif ) of the posterolateral fragment of the tibia and fibula fractures were achieved .\nonce completed , the tourniquet was deflated and a medially placed external fixator that spans the ankle joint was applied .\nthe external fixation pins were placed well away from the subsequent surgical incision both proximally and distally . after reduction ,\nthe purpose of so doing was to maintain tibial length and make the distal tibial fractures relative stable ; thus , allowing soft tissue healing .\nonce edema had resolved , generally within 7 - 14 days postinjury , surgery could be performed .\nthe limb was cleaned and draped in the sterile field from the level of the tourniquet to the toes .\nthe frame was initially removed and flashed for sterility so that could be reused intraoperatively as a distractor .\nthe anterolateral approach was useful for many complex and complete articular and partial articular fracture patterns .\nthe incision was centered at the ankle parallel to the fourth metatarsal distally and between the tibia and fibula proximally as described by herscovici et al.13 full - thickness skin flaps were maintained while dissecting through the subcutaneous tissues .\nthe superficial peroneal nerve would likely cross proximal to the ankle in the surgical field and was identified , mobilized and protected throughout the exposure .\nthe fascia over the anterior compartment of the distal tibia and the extensor compartment was incised sharply and the anterior compartment tendons were all retracted medially . during the procedure , the full - thickness skin flap was gently lifted with a small skin retractor and k - wire was placed distally on the anterior medial portion of the ankle joint proximal to the articular fracture fragments .\nwhen placed , the k - wires were bent at a right angle to protect any assistants during this procedure .\nthe k - wires used for retraction permitted excellent visualization of the metaphyseal - diaphyseal region and exposure to the medial aspect of the distal tibia .\nreduction should proceed to reconstruct the joint surface . during this time , with the retracting k - wires in place , there was no excess traction on the skin and soft tissues .\nthe retraction k - wires were then removed once the anterolateral plate was applied [ figure 1c ] .\nif needed , a second , medially based incision was used for reduction of separate medial malleolar fractures and for percutaneous medial plate or screw application [ figure 2 ] .\nwound closure then beginning with deep vicryl sutures ( ethicon , somerville , new jersey ) .\nthe subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted 2.0 vicryl sutures and the skin was closed with interrupted 2.0 nylon vertical mattress sutures . the vacuum assisted closure system ( kinetic concepts inc .\n, san antonio , tx ) was used to achieve npwt over the surgical incision including anterolateral and medial incision if existed .\nnpwt were applied in the operating room and then changed on postoperative day 2 and every 1 -

22 days ) .\nall patients who underwent an anterolateral approach were treated using the no touch technique during definitive orif .\npatients in the study had npwt applied to their wound for a mean of 60 h ( range 20 - 219 h ) .\nall patients received preoperative intravenous antibiotics and postoperative intravenous antibiotics for 24 - 48 h. only one patient developed superficial infection and resolved with antibiotics and local wound care .\nhistorically , surgical treatment of pilon fractures has been fraught with wound complications and many authors have reported poor results particularly when primary orif was used .\nthey noted skin slough in 27% of their cases and a 37% infection rate in their high - energy fractures .\nsimilarly , in a study by mcferran and smith4 evaluating complications encountered in the treatment of plafond fractures , the local complication rate was 54% .\nof these patients , 13 had wound breakdown , 3 had inadequate soft tissue coverage , 9 had a deep soft tissue infection \/ osteomyelitis and 6 had superficial wound infections .\neighteen soft tissue coverage procedures were required in addition to multiple debridements and closure attempts .\nthis growing body of literature led to the concept that the soft tissue injury can be more severe than the fracture classification implies , leading to an underestimation of the wound complication risk .\nsubsequently , a staged approach to management for high - energy plafond fractures was developed . during the first stage and by means of immediate external fixation , the fracture was provisionally stabilized , allowing soft tissue edema to resolve before formal orif .\ndefinitive fixation was delayed for 7 - 22 days until swelling had diminished , fracture blisters had resolved and the skin displayed  wrinkling .\nthis delay was identical to the findings of both sirkin et al . and patterson and cole.78 furthermore , the frame was initially removed and flashed for sterility so that it can be reused intraoperatively as a distractor during the definitive surgery .\nthe reason for this was that the fixator could help maintain length and the definitive plating could then take place with less manipulation of the soft tissues .\nincision placement affects the surgeon 's ability to see , reduce and stabilize bony and articular fragments and can further traumatize overlying soft tissues .\nthe use of the anterolateral approach to the distal tibia and ankle has become accepted for orif of pilon fractures .\nthis is because of improved understanding of pilon fracture patterns , availability of precontoured anterolateral plates and most importantly because it provides an extensile exposure of the distal tibia and tibiotalar joint .\nseveral reports1415 have presented evidence that pilon fracture patterns are predictable and that most comminution occurs in the anterolateral aspect of the distal tibia .\nherscovici et al.13 described the use of an anterolateral surgical approach to the ankle and stated that this approach has the advantage of providing not only good exposure of the distal tibia , but also easy access to distal anterolateral ( chaput ) fracture fragments , thereby allowing direct reduction of the articular surface .\nanother potential advantage of this approach is that it provides greater soft tissue coverage over the implants when compared with the traditional anteromedial approach .\nwe found that the anterolateral approach provided excellent exposure to the distal tibia for intraarticular pilon fracture reduction and fixation . as a result of the location of the anterolateral incision , a second\n, medially based incision can be used for reduction of separate medial malleolar fractures and for percutaneous medial plate or screw application . however , to adequately visualize the fracture during fixation , oftentimes the soft tissues are retracted for a significant amount of time .\nthe retraction of compromised soft tissues and swelling that is often present at the time of fixation may lead to complications .\nthe swelling may be decreased from the initial injury with staged protocol , but is still present at fixation and can contribute to a poor outcome . with the no - touch technique , there is no retraction of the soft tissues , with the exception of the initial placement of the k - wires .\nthus , the use of the no - touch technique resulted in a low complication rate .\nalthough , the concept of the application of npwt to open and dehisced wounds is well - established in the literature , there is little literature regarding the potential application over incisions to prevent complications in high risk wounds . a recently published study by timmers et al.16 applied npwt to patients forearms with an intact soft tissue envelope .\nthese data suggest a statistically significant increase in microvascular blood flow to the skin.16 a number of clinical experience and animal data also suggest increased blood flow as a result of application of npwt.17181920212223 the mechanism of action of npwt to augment wound healing is not completely understood .\nthere are at least three proposed mechanisms : increased blood flow through the capillary vessels ; edema reduction ; and mechanical stretching of cells leading to cell growth and expansion.1724 based on the results of the above study , application of npwt to surgical incisions immediately after surgical fixation and closure should be considered after high - energy pilon fractures to decrease wound complications ; although , good closure was achieved.25 the limitations of the study are : this is a retrospective study .\nit does not provide a statistical comparison with a control group for operative treatment of complex pilon fractures .\nthe focus of the study was on wound healing and soft tissue complications ; therefore , this duration of followup was deemed to be sufficient as opposed to complications arising at a later time caused by nonunion , loss of fixation , malunion or late osteomyelitis .\nfurther study is required to examine these late complications and whether they may be related to the use of the strategy of  soft tissue control . \nfinally , our sample size is relatively small and it is therefore difficult to predict trends that may occur with a larger cohort of patients with pilon fractures treated using the strategy of soft tissue control . to conclude , this study represents a case series of ao \/ ota ( orthopaedic trauma association ) type c pilon fractures treated with the strategy of\n all fractures reviewed were ao \/ ota ( orthopaedic trauma association ) type c fractures with 61% being type c3 .\nwe feel that this played a large role in our ability to manage the soft tissue postoperatively and limit a relatively low incidence of soft tissue complications despite being at a high risk for complication .\nas successful management of pilon fractures relies in part on avoidance of complications , this series provides evidence that the strategy of  soft tissue control  can reliably be used for fixation of these complex injuries .","abstract":" background : pilon fractures are challenging to manage because of the complexity of the injury pattern and the risk of significant complications . the soft tissue injury and handling of the soft tissue envelope are crucial in pilon fracture outcomes . \n the purpose of this study was to evaluate the early rate of complications using the strategy of  soft tissue control  for operative treatment of complex pilon fractures.materials and methods:36 complex pilon fractures were treated with the  soft tissue control  strategy . \n patients followed the standard staged protocol , anterolateral approach to the distal tibia , the  no -

desmethyl gefitinib ( figure 1b).13 previous studies indicate that among gefitinib metabolites , only o - desmethyl gefitinib can be identified in human plasma , whereas the plasma concentrations of other gefitinib metabolites , such as m537194 and m387783 , which are metabolized by cyp3a4 are very low or even undetectable.2,1316 there are several studies showing that patients with poor metabolizers ( pms ) of cyp2d6 and inhibition of cyp3a4 may lead to prominent overdose of gefitinib , which may finally cause gefitinib - induced hepatotoxicity.13,16 therefore , we believe that it is necessary to evaluate the effects of 24 cyp2d6 variants on the metabolism of gefitinib in vitro . as a member of cyp450 enzyme superfamily , cyp450 2d6 plays a vital role in the metabolism of ~20%30% of therapeutically important drugs , mainly including antipsychotic drugs , antiarrhythmic agents , tricyclic antidepressants , -blockers , and opioids.17,18 like other cyp450 enzymes , cyp2d6 exhibits significant genetic polymorphisms between individuals . to date\n, over 100 cyp2d6 alleles have been identified and named by the human cyp allele nomenclature committee ( http:\/\/www.cypalleles.ki.se\/cyp2d6.htm ) .\nthus , individuals can be classified into four phenotypes : pms , intermediate metabolizers , extensive metabolizers ( ems ) , or ultrarapid metabolizers .\ngenetic polymorphisms in cyp2d6 have been shown to have clinical consequences , resulting in toxicity and\/or altered efficacy of many drugs .\nthus , the identification of the polymorphic allele , especially defective alleles , in different racial or ethnic populations , is of great importance to understand the differences in the clinical response to drugs.19 previously , 22 new nonsynonymous mutation sites among the 2,129 people of the chinese han population were discovered , 12 of them were defined as the novel alleles ( cyp2d6 * 87*93 , * 94a , * 94b , and * 95*98 ) by the human cyp allele nomenclature committee.20 in our study , we systematically assessed the enzymatic characteristics of these 22 cyp2d6 allelic variants and 2 typical variants ( cyp2d6.2 and cyp2d6.10 ) as well as the wild type cyp2d6.1 toward gefitinib .\nand we hope that our data can provide valuable information about cyp2d6 genetic polymorphisms and offer a reference to the personalized medication for cyp2d6-metabolized drugs .\ngefitinib and its metabolite o -

desmethyl gefitinib was detected . except for cyp2d6.92 and cyp2d6.96\n, the remaining 22 variants displayed considerable differences in km , vmax , ksi , or intrinsic clearance values compared with wild - type cyp2d6.1 .\nthree allelic variants ( cyp2d6.10 , cyp2d6.93 , and e215k ) exhibited lower vmax values and eight variants ( cyp2d6.2 , cyp2d6.10 , cyp2d6.98 , r25q , e215k , d336n , r344q , and r440c ) had higher km values than that of cyp2d6.1 ( * p<0.05 ) . according to the intrinsic clearance values when compared with the wild - type , only one variant ( cyp2d6.94 ) had increased catalytic activity to 184.78% , whereas the remaining 13 variants ( cyp2d6.2 , cyp2d6.10 , cyp2d6.87 , cyp2d6.90 , cyp2d6.93 , cyp2d6.95 , cyp2d6.98 , r25q , e215k , v327 m , d336n , r440c , and r497c ) had a significant decrease in enzyme activities compared with cyp2d6.1 ( * p<0.05 ) , for which the percentage varied from 3.11% to 69.42% .\nespecially , the intrinsic clearance values for variants cyp2d6.10 , cyp2d6.93 , and e215k were decreased to 3.11% , 3.68% , and 9.79% compared with cyp2d6.1 , respectively . however , through the analysis of the kinetic parameters , there are eight variants ( cyp2d6.88 , cyp2d6.89 , cyp2d6.91 , cyp2d6.97 , v342 m , r344q , f219s , and f164l ) which showed no marked difference in intrinsic clearance values compared with wild type . in addition , different from the previous studies,19,2124 the metabolic ability toward gefitinib in vitro exhibited substrate inhibition trend , the inhibition constant of 25 tested cyp2d6 variants varied from nearly 5.9 to 158.1 m .\ncyp2d6 plays a major role in the oxidation of ~20%30% prescription drugs , and it is involved in the metabolism of gefitinib to its active metabolite , o - desmethyl gefitinib . according to the research , the formation of o - desmethyl gefitinib seems to be dependent on cyp2d6 activity .\ntherefore , polymorphisms in the cyp2d6 gene can greatly influence the rate of elimination of gefitinib .\nindividuals who are pms of cyp2d6 have twofold higher plasma concentrations of gefitinib than ems.14 up to now , the enzymatic characteristics of cyp2d6 alleles toward gefitinib have not been well studied both in vivo and in vitro .\ncyp2d6.2 and cyp2d6.10 tend to undergo the most study of the variants . in order to improve the credibility of our experiment , cyp2d6.2 and cyp2d6.10\n, two typical variants , served as the positive controls for the functional analyses . cyp2d6 * 10 is the most common allele in asians , occurring in 42.86% of the chinese han population.20,25 several functional analyses have been shown that cyp2d6.10 has higher km , lower vmax and behave with the least vmax \/ km values for dextromethorphan , bufuralol , nortriptyline , atomoxetine , and debrisoquine in vitro.21,25 \n cyp2d6 * 10 is generally considered to be an allele associated with the intermediate metabolizer phenotype . for typical defective allele cyp2d6 * 2 , cai et al found it exhibited lower intrinsic clearance value for dextromethorphan and bufuralol , ~43.85% and 40.41% of wild type , respectively.21 as a consequence , in our study the relative clearance of cyp2d6.2 ( 23.43% of cyp2d6.1 ) and cyp2d6.10 ( 3.11% of cyp2d6.1 ) were both presented significantly decreased .\nthese results were consistent with previous work and indicate that it is appropriate to use our cyp expression and in vitro metabolism system for analyzing the catalytic activities of the other cyp2d6 variants.21,22,26,27 to better understand the enzymatic characteristics of cyp2d6 allelic isoforms and their effects on the metabolism of gefitinib in vitro , we functionally analyzed the enzymatic activity of 22 novel cyp2d6 alleles toward gefitinib using recombinant insect microsomes .\nwe found that some of the variants showed similar trend about the enzyme activity as studies reported,21,27 but some caused increased or no change in enzyme activity , which is not in accordance with the results of previous research .\nit indicates that cyp2d6 not only exhibits significant genetic polymorphisms between individuals and among different races and ethnicities , but also showed marked differences on the metabolism of various clinical drugs .\ntherefore , it is of great necessity to undertake further research on the function of cyp2d6 alleles on the metabolism of gefitinib . in our study ,\nboth cyp2d6.92 and cyp2d6.96 had undetectable enzyme activity in gefitinib metabolism , similar to previous reports.19,21,23,24 the reason for this may be because both of these variants were expressed as truncated proteins due to the premature termination in protein translation process , which led to the function loss of enzymatic activity .\nparticularly , only one variant cyp2d6.94 , with a decrease km and an increase vmax , showed significant increased relative clearance compared with cyp2d6.1 , suggesting higher catalytic activity than cyp2d6.1 . on the contrary , as reported in other studies , cyp2d6.94 exhibited markedly different decreased catalytic activity toward propranolol ( 31.37% ) , nebivolol ( 58.23% ) , dextromethorphan ( 67.03% ) , venlafaxine ( 71.9% ) , and bufuralol ( 74.96% ) in vitro.19,21,23,24 these data suggest that cyp2d6.94 may be reclassified as an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype for gefitinib .\nmoreover , cyp2d6.88 , cyp2d6.89 , cyp2d6.91 , cyp2d6.97 , f164l , f219s , and v342 m were found in chinese people and exhibited similar metabolic activity of cyp2d6.1 for gefitinib .\ncai et al showed that cyp2d6.91 , cyp2d6.97 , f164l , f219s , and v342 m exhibited markedly decreased catalytic activity toward bufuralol and dextromethorphan .\nin addition , cyp2d6.88 and cyp2d6.89 exhibited decreased intrinsic clearance for bufuralol as compared with wild type but no significant difference toward dextromethorphan.21 these results suggest that cyp2d6 had substrate - specific alterations in metabolic activity and that results obtained from one substrate can not necessarily be extrapolated to other substrates .\nwe speculate that the different affinity of enzyme and substrate might be responsible for this inconsistency .\nit is important to point out that two allelic variants cyp2d6.93 and e215k exhibited a drastic decrease in enzymatic activity .\ncyp2d6.93 exhibited ~94.4% lower vmax , 1.53-fold higher km , and 96.32% lower intrinsic clearance values compared with wild type .\nas for this result , dai et al speculated that the normal entrance of the cyp2d6 substrate might be blocked , resulting from the replacement of the hydrophilic thr with the hydrophilic pro at position 249 , which would influence the spatial structure of the adjacent egress channel .\ne215k contains an amino acid switch from glu to lys at position 215 , which is located in f - helix in the active site cavity of the cyp2d6 protein.27 that may be related with e215k s extremely decreased intrinsic clearance values ( 9.79% ) of cyp2d6.1 owing to high km ( 5.67-fold ) .\nour data suggests that cyp2d6.93 and e215k may have to be associated with a pm phenotype in vivo , with gefitinib as a substrate .\nseveral studies have reported that patients with nsclc who possessed pm phenotype have severe hepatotoxicity after treatment with gefitinib.16,28 our work may serve as a reference for rational administration clinically , thereby can avoid adverse drug reactions such as gefitinib - induced hepatotoxicity .\nfurthermore , the most meaningful difference between our study and previous reports19,2124 is that gefitinib exhibited a substrate inhibition trend of metabolic ability by cyp2d6 in vitro .\ntwenty - three tested cyp2d6 allelic variants showed this substrate inhibition trend toward gefitinib and their ksi values varied from ~6 to 158 m .\nas reported in a study by swaisland et al , suggested that gefitinib produced a little inhibition of cyp2d6 isoenzyme activity which resulted in a small increase in the metoprolol area under the curve and the maximum serum concentration.29 hereby , we know that gefitinib was both an inhibitor and a substrate of cyp2d6\nin addition , we believe that it is still valuable to pay more consideration to the dose of cyp2d6 substrates which have a narrow therapeutic window when in the presence of gefitinib .\nin summary , we systematically assessed the enzymatic activity of 24 cyp2d6 allelic isoforms on the metabolism of gefitinib .\nin addition , it has been reported that inhibition of cyp3a4 leads to a shunt to a cyp2d6-dependent metabolic pathway .\ntherefore , we speculate that patients with these dysfunctional cyp2d6 alleles should reduce the dosage of gefitinib in order to avoid gefitinib - induced hepatotoxicity when functions of cyp3a4 are also inhibited . moreover , further studies in vivo or in vitro on the effects of cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 toward gefitinib are required to make sense of the relation between cyps and gefitinib clearance . as the first study of these alleles for gefitinib metabolism","abstract":" backgroundcytochrome p450 2d6 ( cyp2d6 ) , a member of the cyp450 enzyme super family , is a polymorphic enzyme that metabolizes ~25% of therapeutic drugs . \n cyp2d6 exhibits significant genetic polymorphisms which might cause adverse effects and therapeutic failures of some drugs.objectivethe purpose of this study was to evaluate the catalytic activities of 22 novel cyp2d6 alleles ( cyp2d6 * 87 , * 88 , * 89 , * 90 , * 91 , * 92 , * 93 , * 94 , * 95 , * 96 , * 97 , * 98 , r25q , f164l , e215k , f219s , v327 m , d336n , v342 m , r344q , r440c , r497c ) on the metabolism of gefitinib in vitro.methods and resultscyp2d6 variants were incubated with 1100 m gefitinib for 60 min at 37c and the reaction was terminated by cooling to 80c immediately . \n gefitinib and its metabolite o - desmethyl gefitinib were analyzed by an ultra - performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry system . \n compared to cyp2d6.1 , most cyp2d6 variants exhibited significantly decreased relative clearance values ( from 3.11% to 79.35% ) , whereas cyp2d6.92 and cyp2d6.96 displayed no detectable enzyme activity . only cyp2d6.94 exhibited a markedly increased intrinsic clearance value , and eight variants ( cyp2d6.88 , cyp2d6.89 , cyp2d6.91 , cyp2d6.97 , v342 m , r344q , f219s , and f164l ) showed no significant difference . \n in addition , 23 cyp2d6 allelic isoforms exhibited substrate inhibition trend toward gefitinib.conclusionas the first study of all the aforementioned alleles for gefitinib metabolism , these comprehensive data may help in the clinical assessment of the metabolism of gefitinib , and may also offer a reference for personalized treatment with gefitinib in clinical settings .

two millimeters . for four children ( patients 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 ) , imaging depicted no change in cyst size between the time of antenatal detection and ct scan at one month of life .\nconversely , cyst size increased 40% in patient 3 and 150% in patient 6 . during the first year of life , cyst size remained stable in four ( patients 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 ) , doubled in one ( patient 2 ) , and increased by 30% within six months in one ( patient 4 ) [ figure 1 ] .\ngrowth of bronchogenic cysts ( in mm ) from antennal diagnosis to the time of surgery the only adverse event observed was pulmonary infection that occurred in only one case ( patient 3 ) at eleven months and was treated at another hospital .\nno other adverse events occurred in this child , but follow -

up strategy in children that undergo resection for bronchogenic cysts .\nhowever , perusal of previous reports on congenital pulmonary malformations highlights a consensus for yearly pulmonary ct - scan .\nour approach after antenatal diagnosis calls for ct - scan without anesthesia at one month after birth to confirm the malformation followed by chest x - ray every three months to rule out parenchymal complications .\nbased on our experience and perusal of the literature , we have concluded that the growth rate of bronchogenic cysts is slow in the first months of life , but that , even in the absence of complications , size increases constantly at an exponential rate .\nwe recommend complete resection before the age of two in order to prevent complications and facilitate surgery .\npatients should be kept under regularly surveillance even though most bronchogenic cysts are now diagnosed antenatally .","abstract":" purpose : the purpose of this study was to describe an approach to surgical management of bronchogenic cysts based on the natural course observed from the time of antenatal screening to surgical resection in patients treated at our institution and reported in the literature.materials and methods : we retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of all children presenting bronchogenic cyst diagnosed antenatally from 2007 to 2010 . \n a total of six children were included.results:antenatal diagnosis was accurate in 62.5% of cases . in the first year of life , the size of the cyst remained stable in four patients , doubled in one , and increased 30% within six months in one . \n the indication for surgery was emphysema of the left bronchus in two patients and rapid growth in two patients . \n one patient is still awaiting surgery.conclusion:bronchogenic cysts grow slowly in the first months of life , but growth is exponential even in the absence of complications . \n we recommend complete resection before the age of two years to prevent infectious complications and facilitate surgery .

Fetal MRI was the preferred method because it allows 3D reconstruction of the structures of the bronchial tree.\nImaging findings showed that fetal bronchogenic cyst had been demonstrated at prenatal ultrasonography in 3 cases (17%), at fetal MRI in 13 cases (76%), and in both imaging methods in 1 case (6%). The median time from diagnosis of the cyst to delivery was 26.7 \u00b1 9 weeks (range 24-37 weeks), and the median birthweight was 1.45 \u00b1 0.9 kg (range 0.7-3.45 kg). The majority of the lesions were isolated, with 5 located in the right lung (29%), 3 in the left lung (17%), and 3 in both lungs (17%), however, only two lesions (11%) presented with a right pulmonary artery fistula. Cystic lesions were associated with bronchial tree anomalies in 15 cases, 8 (47%) had unilateral and 7 (41%) had bilateral bronchial tree anomalies.\nConclusion:\nThese findings are consistent with the role of pulmonary lymphatic drainage in pathogenesis of bronchogenic cysts, and support the hypothesis that the bronchial branches that originate from the lymphatic sinuses could be vulnerable for disruption as a result of their peculiar course.\nThis is the first case report which demonstrates the use of 3D MRI reconstruction to evaluate the prenatal aspect of bronchogenic cyst.\nA total of 17 prenatally diagnosed bronchogenic cysts in which 76% were demonstrated on MRI are presented. The prenatal imaging features of these cysts were different from the postnatal findings as cysts were demonstrated as a single nodule and only 2 (11%) associated with a fistula.\nThis paper describes the prenatal diagnosis of bronchogenic cysts, but also the first prenatal demonstration of the bronchial anatomy. A thorough knowledge of the fetal pulmonary anatomy is crucial to establish the prenatal diagnosis of bronchogenic cysts.\n[Keywords: Prenatal diagnosis, Lung cyst, Bron"}
{"article":"the neurotransmitter pharmacology of nociceptive processing is of great importance in our understanding of pain mechanisms and therapy .\nunderstanding of the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in nociception is extensive at the level of the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord ( lesage , 2004 ; millan , 1999 ) .\nthe ventrobasal thalamus ( vb ) is a pivotal processing point for the integration of somatosensory information ascending from the spinal cord with a prominent descending cortico - thalamic input from layer 6 of the corresponding somatosensory cortex ( sherman , 2012 ) .\nprevious work from this laboratory and others has shown that responses of thalamic neurones to noxious peripheral stimuli are largely mediated by glutamate receptors , in particular the ionotropic nmda receptor ( bordi and quartaroli , 2000 ; eaton and salt , 1990 ; kolhekar et  al . ,\n1997 ) and the metabotropic glutamate ( mglu ) receptors , mglu1 and mglu5 ( eaton et  al . , 1993 ; salt and binns , 2000 ; salt and turner , 1998 ) .\nthere are eight mglu receptor subtypes ( mglu1-mglu8 ) that can be placed into three groups ( group i , ii , iii ) based on sequence homology , intracellular transduction cascade , and agonist \/ antagonist pharmacology ( niswender and conn , 2010 ) .\ngroup i receptors ( mglu1 , mglu5 ) are often ( but not exclusively ) localised post - synaptically where they may couple to inositol phosphate metabolism and enhance post - synaptic excitability via changes in k conductances and\/or modulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors ( niswender and conn , 2010 ) .\nin addition to selective agonists and antagonists , a novel class of pharmacological agents acting at mglu receptors has more recently become available , the positive allosteric modulators ( pams ) ( nicoletti et  al . , 2011 ) .\npams act at sites on the receptor distinct from the orthosteric ligand ( glutamate ) binding site and enhance the activity of receptors in response to orthosteric agonists ( nicoletti et  al . , 2011 ) .\nthis has advantages in that pams can be highly selective for single mglu receptor subtypes and can function to potentiate the physiological activation of receptors by endogenous glutamate .\nwe have shown that one such pam , ro67 - 4853 ( knoflach et  al . , 2001 ) , can be used in in  vivo experiments to potentiate responses mediated via mglu1 receptors in an activity - dependent manner ( salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nthus , ro67 - 4853 is an appropriate tool to investigate possible mglu1 involvement in thalamic nociceptive processing . the present study aimed to investigate the involvement and function of mglu1 receptors in nociceptive processing in the thalamus .\nwe have achieved this by potentiating mglu1 receptor mediated responses with the selective pam ro67 - 4853 and by reducing mglu1 receptor activation using the selective antagonist ly367385 ( clark et  al . , 1997 ) whilst recording nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones .\nfurthermore , given the association of mglu1 receptors with cortico - thalamic pathways ( godwin et  al .\n, 1996 ; martin et  al . , 1992 ; vidnyanszky et  al . ,\n1996 ) , we investigated the effect of somatosensory cortex inactivation on nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones . we show that it is possible to substantially change nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones by increasing or decreasing the degree of mglu1 receptor activation and that nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones are dependent upon a functional cortico - thalamic projection .\nthis is important in understanding sensory processing and the design of novel analgesic therapies , and underlines the critical role of mglu1 receptors in sensory processing in the thalamus .\nexperiments were carried out in male adult wistar rats ( 270400  g ) anaesthetised with urethane ( 1.2  g \/ kg , i.p . ) , as detailed previously ( salt , 1987 ; salt and binns , 2000 ; salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nanimals were purchased from harlan ( uk ) and were housed on a 12  h light \/ dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water .\nall procedures were subject to local ethical committee review , were approved by the home office ( uk ) and were in accordance with the animals ( scientific procedures ) act 1986 .\nan approximately 5  mm - square unilateral craniotomy centred over the thalamus ( 3  mm lateral to the midline , 5  mm rostral to the inter - aural line ( paxinos and watson , 1988 ) ) was made and the dura resected to expose the surface of the cortex .\nin addition to overlying the thalamus , this area of cortex contains the hindlimb and trunk \/ tail representation of the s1 somatosensory cortex ( chapin and lin , 1984 ) . in some experiments\nthe craniotomy was surrounded by a small open chamber cemented to the skull that could be filled with either mineral oil or physiological saline ; in the remaining experiments the surface of the brain was protected by agar ( 2% in physiological saline ) .\nextracellular recordings were made from single neurones in the vb and immediately dorsal thalamus using either tungsten - in - glass electrodes or , for pharmacological experiments , the central barrel of seven - barrel glass iontophoretic electrodes .\nsingle neurone action potential spikes were gated using a hardware spike - discriminator whose output pulses were timed and recorded by a ced1401 interface and computer system with spike2 software . the amplitude and shape of the gated action potentials\nneurones were identified on the basis of their stereotaxic location ( ap  + 5.0  mm from lambda , lateral 2.9  mm from midline , depth 4.65.2  mm from surface ) and their responses to somatosensory ( nociceptive and non - nociceptive ) stimuli , as described previously ( guilbaud et  al . , 1980 ; peschanski et  al . , 1980 , 1983 ; salt and binns , 2000 ) .\nnociceptive responses were evoked by immersion of part of either the contralateral hindpaw or the tail in water of 52c for 20  s. responses to such stimuli were typically increases in action potential firing during the course of the stimulus and outlasting the stimulus by up to 2  min , as described previously ( peschanski et  al . , 1980 ) .\nsimilar response profiles were observed irrespective of the recording electrode type or the type of craniotomy preparation .\nnoxious stimuli were repeated at regular 5-min intervals in experiments where modulation of nociceptive responses was investigated ( see below ) . for pharmacological experiments , substances under investigation\nwere applied in the recording location from the six outer barrels of the electrode using the iontophoretic technique ( stone , 1985 ) with a neurophore bh2 system .\neach of the outer barrels contained a selection from one of the following substances : nmda ( n - methyl - d - aspartate , 50  mm , ph 8.0 in 150  mm nacl ) ; ampa ( s - alpha - amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate , 50  mm , ph 8.0 in 150  mm nacl ) ; ly367385 ( 100  mm in water , ph 8.0 ) ; dhpg ( s-3,5-dihydroxy - phenylglycine , 50  mm in 150  mm nacl , ph 3.5 ) ; ro67 - 4853 ( 2  mm in 10% dmso in 150  mm nacl , ph 7.5 ) , vehicle control ( 10% dmso in 150  mm nacl , ph 7.5 ) , pontamine sky blue dye ( 2% in 1  m nacl ) , 1  m nacl .\nall pharmacological agents were obtained from tocris bioscience ( uk ) , apart from ro67 - 4853 , which was a gift from roche pharmaceuticals ( switzerland ) .\nagents were prevented from diffusing from the iontophoresis barrel by applying a retaining current ( 515  na ) of opposite polarity to the ejection current .\nautomatic current balancing was routinely performed through the 1  m nacl - containing barrel . in experiments where the effects of either the pam or antagonist on agonist responses were evaluated ,\nregular repeated cycles of agonist ejections were set up and initiated by the computer system which also produced online peristimulus - histograms ( psths ) of single - neurone activity .\nthe effects of the pam or antagonist on agonist effects were assessed by continuous concurrent iontophoretic application of these agents during several cycles of agonist ejection .\nthus , although it is not possible to give absolute tissue concentrations of agents , we are confident that the doses used are within the range of producing physiologically relevant and pharmacologically selective effects . in experiments where the effects of either the pam or antagonist on nociceptive responses were investigated , these agents were ejected with similar iontophoretic parameters to those found to be effective on responses to agonists . in experiments designed to investigate the influence of cortical activity on thalamic responses , we inactivated the s1 somatosensory cortex by cooling ( clemo and stein , 1986 ; diamond et  al . , 1992 ) .\nafter responses to noxious stimuli of a neurone were established , the warm physiological saline in the well overlying the cortex was gently aspirated and replaced with chilled ( 4c ) saline every 23  min for up to 10  min and the effect on the nociceptive responses noted . finally , the saline was replaced with warm saline and nociceptive responses were further recorded . in separate experiments ,\na miniature thermocouple was inserted into the cortex to a depth of 1  mm and it was found that the cooling procedure reduced the temperature at this point to 15c . when the thermocouple was moved down into the body of the thalamus , no change in temperature could be detected when the cortical cooling procedure was performed .\nresponses to agonists or noxious stimuli were quantified as the number of action potentials evoked by agonist ejection or stimulus , from which psths were plotted .\nthe effects of the pam , the antagonist , or cortical inactivation on these responses were assessed by calculating the agonist or stimulus response during these experimental manipulations as a percentage of the response under control conditions . in the case of nociceptive responses ,\n maintained response components were computed : the initial component was the number of action potential spikes evoked during the nociceptive stimulus whereas the maintained response was the number of action potential spikes occurring during the minute immediately after the stimulus .\ndata from individual neurones were used to compute mean values of effects ( s.e.m . ) .\nstatistical comparisons of these values under control conditions and during experimental manipulations were made using the wilcoxon signed rank test .\nrecordings were made from 25 neurones that were characterised as nociceptive thalamic neurones on the basis of their stereotaxic location and responses to noxious stimuli directed at the contralateral limbs and tail as described previously ( guilbaud et  al .\ntypically these neurones were located above or lateral to the vibrissal representation in the vb complex , had low spontaneous firing rates ( 0.052.4 spikes per second ) and responded to noxious stimuli with a graded increase in firing rate that outlasted the stimulus , as described previously ( eaton and salt , 1990 ; guilbaud et  al . , 1980 ; peschanski et  al . , 1980 ; salt and binns , 2000 ) .\ni agonist dhpg ( 2080  na , 1020  s ) caused increases in action potential firing rate of the thalamic neurones , as previously described ( salt and binns , 2000 ; salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nprevious work from this laboratory has indicated that this excitatory response to dhpg is mediated predominantly via mglu1 receptors ( salt and binns , 2000 ) . in order to evaluate the ability of ro67 - 4853 to potentiate mglu1\nreceptor mediated responses of nociceptive thalamic neurones , we co - applied this pam ( 50150  na ) during regular ejections of dhpg .\nwe found that this potentiated the dhpg responses to 282    87% ( n  =  6 , p  <  0.05 ) of their pre - ro67 - 4853 control values on nociceptive neurones ( fig .  1 ) .\non vibrissae - responsive ( non - nociceptive ) neurones a similar effect ( 267    33% of control , n  =  19 , p  < \nthis effect was typically reversible within 10  min of the termination of the ro67 - 4853 application .\nit appeared that the greatest degree of potentiation could be achieved when the control response to dhpg was relatively low in terms of increased firing of action potentials .\nthis was borne out by the apparent inverse correlation between the potentiating effect of ro67 - 4853 and the magnitude of the control response to dhpg ( p  <  0.001 ) ( fig . \nthese findings indicate that ro67 - 4853 can potentiate the mglu1-receptor - mediated responses to dhpg of thalamic nociceptive neurones , in agreement with our previous findings on vibrissa - responsive thalamic neurones ( salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nwhen ro67 - 4853 was applied during noxious stimulation on 6 thalamic neurones , the nociceptive responses were potentiated to an overall 247    99% of control values ( p  <  0.05 ) , with a more pronounced effect on the latter ( maintained ) components of the nociceptive responses than on the initial component in 5 of the 6 neurones ( figs .  2 and 3a ) .\nthe effect of ro67 - 4853 reversed upon termination of the ejection . on 4 of these 6 neurones the responses to repeated noxious stimuli were further recorded during co - application of the mglu1 receptor antagonist ly367385 ( 2040  na ) ( fig 2 ) .\nthis antagonist reduced the nociceptive responses in these neurones and in a further 5 neurones where ro67 - 4853 had not been tested ly367385 had a similar effect .\noverall , on the 9 neurones where nociceptive responses were studied with ly367385 , the antagonist reduced responses to 17    9% of control levels with little difference in effect between initial and maintained components of the response profiles ( fig . \n3b ) . in order to verify the selectivity of ly367385 on this population of neurones , we recorded from 8 neurones that were excited by regular ejections of dhpg , nmda and ampa . on all of these neurones , co -\napplication of ly367385 reduced dhpg responses ( to 6    5% of control ) while having little effect on responses to either nmda or ampa ( fig . \nin view of the possibility that the cortico - thalamic projection contributes to the mglu1 receptor - mediated component of thalamic nociceptive responses , we carried out a set of experiments where we inactivated somatosensory cortical activity by cooling the cortex whilst recording thalamic nociceptive responses . in these experiments\n, there was a substantial reduction in the magnitude of nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones to 14    8% of control ( n  =  5 ) ( fig .  5 ) .\nresponses returned to near - control levels in all cases once the cortical cooling procedure had been terminated .\nwe have previously reported that local application of the mglu1 receptor pam , ro67 - 4853 , can enhance dhpg - evoked excitations of somatosensory vibrissae - responsive vb neurones ( salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nthe primary finding of the present study is that this pam has similar effects on nociceptive thalamic neurones and is able to substantially enhance nociceptive responses of these neurones .\nfurthermore , in an extension to our previous studies , we have shown that nociceptive thalamic responses are sensitive to antagonism by a selective mglu1 receptor antagonist ( ly367385 ) , and finally that the nociceptive responses are dependent on an intact cortical input .\ninactivation of the sensory cortex has been used as a means of investigating cortical influences on subcortical areas in a variety of species and sensory systems ( binns and salt , 1996 ; clemo and stein , 1986 ; marrocco et  al . , 1982 ;\n, 1993 , 1994 ; wickelgren and sterling , 1969 ) including the rat somatosensory cortex ( diamond et  al . , 1992 ; yuan et  al . , 1985 ) :\ncooling of somatosensory cortex appears to be a useful means of producing a reversible inactivation to study corticofugal influences on somatosensory thalamic processing in the rat ( diamond et  al . , 1992 ) .\n( 1992 ) found that such a procedure had little effect on vibrissa responses of ventrobasal thalamus neurones although responses of posterior group ( pom ) thalamic neurones were reduced . in the present study , using similar procedures , we found that nociceptive responses were profoundly reduced by cortical inactivation , and this might at first reflect a greater involvement of cortico - thalamic circuitry in nociceptive responses compared to vibrissal responses but might also reflect patterns of vibrissal input ( salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nro67 - 4853 has been documented as a pam that is selective at mglu1 receptors across a range of species with an ec50 of approximately 0.1  m ( knoflach et  al . , 2001 ) .\nthis selectivity is borne out by our present finding that ro67 - 4853 can enhance responses to dhpg in a similar manner to the potentiation seen on hippocampal neurones in  vitro ( knoflach et  al . , 2001 ) , and is consistent with the high levels of expression of mglu1 receptors compared to mglu5 receptors in the thalamus ( martin et  al . , 1992 ; neto et  al . , 2000 ; shigemoto et  al . ,\nour findings that nociceptive responses are potentiated by an mglu1 pam and reduced by an mglu1 antagonist provide compelling evidence to suggest that mglu1 receptors are activated during this physiological stimulation .\nthe most likely physiological source of the mglu1 receptor - mediated component of thalamic responses is the layer 6 cortico - thalamic input to thalamic neurones in view of the anatomical location of these receptors on distal dendrites close to terminals likely of cortical origin ( godwin et  al .\n, 1996 ; martin et  al . , 1992 ; vidnyanszky et  al . ,\nthis is further supported by in  vitro electrophysiological experiments where stimulation of the cortical input to thalamic neurones that can be reduced with mglu1 antagonists ( reichova and sherman , 2004 ; turner and salt , 2000 ) .\nconsistent with this , we have found in the present study that inactivation of the somatosensory cortex reduces the nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones . taken together\n, this suggests that responses of thalamic neurones to noxious stimuli are a consequence of recruitment of cortical circuitry in addition to sensory input .\nit is of interest that a similar suggestion has been made for thalamic responses in the somatosensory vibrissal system and the visual system in  vivo and that the degree of recruitment may depend on the stimulus parameters that are used ( rivadulla et  al . , 2002 ; salt et  al . , 2012 ) .\nit is evident that manipulation of mglu1 activation either in an upward ( with pam ) or downward ( with antagonist ) direction has a profound effect on the nociceptive responses of thalamic neurones in  vivo .\nthis may at first sight seem somewhat surprising , as the apparent direct contribution of mglu1 receptors to synaptic responses in thalamic slice experiments appears to be relatively small ( turner and salt , 2000 )\n. this may in part be due to the relatively distal dendritic location of mglu1 receptors ( godwin et  al .\n, 1996 ; martin et  al . , 1992 ; vidnyanszky et  al . , 1996 ) , but it is also known that mglu1 receptor activation can have very non - linear effects on thalamic neuronal membrane properties ( mccormick and von krosigk , 1992 ; turner and salt , 2000 ; williams et  al . , 1997 ) , and this would enhance responses mediated via ionotropic receptors ( e.g. nmda or ampa receptors ) . in addition direct positive modulation of nmda receptors by mglu receptors has been demonstrated , and we have previously shown that low , subthreshold , levels of mglu1 activation can enhance thalamic neurone responses nmda and ampa receptor activation ( salt and binns , 2000 ) . finally , it has been shown that activation of the mglu1-phospholipase c beta 4 ( plc beta 4 ) molecular pathway can enhance the tonic firing mode of thalamic nociceptive neurones ( cheong et  al . , 2008 ) .\nthus mglu1 receptors appear to be critically placed to play a dynamic role in controlling the responses to nociceptive stimuli of thalamic neurones . however , it is important to note that there is evidence to suggest some involvement of mglu5 receptors in thalamic nociceptive responses , although this is unlikely to arise from cortical input ( salt and binns , 2000 ) .\ninterestingly , both ro67 - 4853 and ly367385 appeared to have a much greater influence on thalamic nociceptive responses than the effects they produced on vibrissal responses reported by ourselves previously ( salt et  al . , 2012 ) ; this is parallelled by the large effect of cortical inactivation on nociceptive responses that we have described compared to the lack of effect of cortical inactivation on vibrissal responses of ventrobasal thalamus neurones ( diamond et  al . ,\nour findings demonstrate the pivotal contribution that mglu1 receptors make to nociceptive processing at the thalamic level .\nthis is important in terms of understanding nociceptive mechanisms and in the design of novel therapeutics .\nhowever , given that mglu1 receptors have been implicated in synaptic plasticity ( nicoletti et  al . , 2011 ;\nniswender and conn , 2010 ) , our findings suggest that plastic mechanisms may be activated under these conditions in  vivo , and may underlie changes that may occur in chronic pain conditions .\nmoreover they underline the role that the cortical feedback may have in chronic pain and highlight the potential for development of pharmacological intervention targeting these mechanisms in the clinical treatment of chronic pain .","abstract":" as postsynaptic metabotropic subtype 1 ( mglu1 ) receptors are present in the thalamus , we have investigated the effect of potentiating and antagonising mglu1 receptors on responses of thalamic neurones to noxious sensory stimulation . \n extracellular recordings were made in  vivo with multi - barrel iontophoretic electrodes from single neurones in the thalamus of urethane - anaesthetised rats . \n responses to iontophoretic applications of the group i mglu agonist 3,5-dihydroxy - phenylglycine ( dhpg ) were selectively potentiated by co - application of the mglu1 positive allosteric modulator ro67 - 4853 , whereas they were selectively reduced upon co - application of the mglu1 receptor orthosteric antagonist ly367385 . \n this indicates that thalamic dhpg responses are mediated primarily via mglu1 receptors , consistent with the high postsynaptic levels of this receptor in the thalamus . \n furthermore , potentiation of dhpg responses by ro67 - 4853 were greater when the initial dhpg response was of a low magnitude . \n ro67 - 4853 also potentiated responses of thalamic neurones to noxious thermal stimulation , whilst having little effect on the baseline activity of nociceptive neurones . \n by contrast , nociceptive responses were reduced by ly367385 . in a further series of experiments we found that inactivation of somatosensory cortex by cooling resulted in a reduction of thalamic nociceptive responses . \n these results underline the importance of mglu1 receptors in the processing of sensory information in the thalamus , particularly with respect to nociceptive responses . \n furthermore , the involvement of mglu1 receptors may reflect the activity of descending cortico - thalamic afferents .

mdtg group due to hospital transfer one\nsubject made a decision not to \n continue cdtg group training , and one subject was excluded from the analysis due to a poor \n attendance rate of less than 80% in mcdgt group training .\nbefore the intervention , subject s \n general features , balance ability and gait ability were measured and recorded . to improve \n the reliability of the results , one researcher gave an outline and demonstrated in person \n the task performance and experimental order , one week prior to the preliminary measurements \n for the smooth progress of training and for the prevention of accidents .\nalso , for the \n purpose of enhancing inter tester reliability , the testers who were to carry out the same \n test , were allowed to have sufficient discussion and prior education on the test procedures . \n in order to prevent any selection bias ,\nthe subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups , \n and11 subjects in the mdgt group , 11 subjects in the cdgt group and 11 subjects in the mcdgt \n group completed the training of 30 minutes exercise , 3 times a week , for 8 weeks .\nsubjects in the mdgt group were instructed to perform some motor tasks while continuously \n walking on a treadmill .\nwhile walking on the treadmill , they performed 5 types of motor \n tasks :  tossing up and catching a ball ,  rehanging loops on different hooks ,  doing up \n buttons after unbuttoning7 ,  holding a \n cup of water without spilling it and  receiving and returning a cup of water. three \n minutes were allowed for each task , so 15 minutes were allowed for the set of 5 tasks , and 2 \n sets of tasks were carried out by the subjects9 .\nthe subjects carried out the cognitive dual tasks while maintaining \n their gait on the treadmill .\nmathematical subtraction ,  verbal analogical reasoning ,  spelling words \n backward10 , and  counting \n backward11.three minutes were allowed \n for each task , so 15 minutes were allowed for the set of 5 tasks , and 2 sets of tasks were \n carried out by the subjects .\nthey performed the set of motor dual tasks for 15 minutes and the set of cognitive \n dual tasks for 15 minutes , while maintaining gait on the treadmill .\npasw statistics 18.0 program for windows was used in this research to carry out all the \n statistical analyses . in order to compare gender , paretic\nside and stroke type of the 3 \n groups , the  test was used , and one - way anova was used to compare age , height , \n and weight , and to test the homogeneity of the dependent variables before training .\nthe \n kolmorogov - smirnov test was used to test the normality of the data .\nthe paired t - test was \n used to check the difference between pre- and post - treatment in each group . in order to \n compare the difference depending on the type of therapy among the 3 groups , we used analysis \n of covariance ( ancova ) , setting the group variable of 3 groups as the fixed factor , and the \n post - training scores as dependent variables after having controlled for the pre - test score \n of dependent variables as covariance .\nthe changes in balance and gait abilities between pre- and post- training are

.\ninvestigated how the degree of postural sway varied \n with performance of a dual task while walking , using patients who had had hemiplegia for 16 \n months on average as subjects .\nthey reported that the degree of postural sway decreased \n while the patients were carrying out a dual task .\nthis research result of hyndman et \n al.14 is also consistent with our \n present findings . in the

sway was corrected \n better when patients performed a dual task of just keeping in contact with a curtain without \n pulling it , than when they carried out a single task of balance .\ntheir result is supported \n by the research of wulf and prinz16 , who \n concluded that the external focus of attention , concentrating on the result of the movement , \n is more effective than the internal focus of attention , concentrating on the movement \n itself .\nsilsupadol et al.12 conducted a study in \n which healthy elderly subjects performed dual tasks 3 times a week for 4 weeks .\nthe subject \n

while walking on a treadmill .\nwhen the gait speed was compared among the 3 groups in the 10  m wt , which is designed to \n measure the gait competence of chronic stroke patients , the mcdgt group

performing a cognitive dual task of a mathematic calculation .\nthey \n reported that the subject s postural sway incresed during performance of the cognitive dual \n task , a mathematical calculation , and there was no direct relation with the maintenance of \n correct posture , while postural sway decresed during the performance of the motor dual task \n for which the subjects were required to hold a tray with cups of water on it .\nthey further \n noted that the subjects consciously tried to hold the tray horizontally while they performed \n the motor task of holding the tray with cups of water on it , and that this conscious effort \n reduced the postural sway .\ntheir findings were confirmed by vereijken et al.23 , who reported that the internal focus of \n attention , concentrating on the movement itself , during the performance of a motor task \n inhibits self - operating postural control due to conscious control of the posture , while the \n external focus of attention , concentrating on the result of the movement during the motor \n task , promotes self - operating postural control .\nour present research could not thoroughly exclude the influence of subjects daily living \n activities on their balance and gait because it was not possible to entirely control the \n experimental subjects daily living activities , and this is a limiting factor of this \n research

Acute onset of stroke is a sudden attack of neurological deficit. Acute stroke may include subacute stroke that may cause only minor neurological changes such as speech impairment (aphasia), visual impairment (apoplexia or blindness), paralysis of half or half the body, or other symptoms. On the contrary, subacute stroke may recover over a longer period, without any permanent damage. Chronic stroke can be defined as a condition in which the person suffers from any neurological deficit or a progressive deficit that continues for longer than 24\u00a0h.\n\nAcute stroke is a medical emergency and immediate stroke care (ISC) is very critical; the purpose is to reduce disability and mortality associated with acute stroke [1]. \n\n2.2 Stroke impact and disability\n\nThe impact of stroke has both clinical and health economic implications for patients, their families, their carers, and society at large. After acute stroke, mortality is highest in the first week, and then falls to half the level after 1\u00a0month. Stroke can be fatal or leave a permanent disability (PAD).\n\nStroke survivors usually experience a period of recovery where they face a variety of challenges, but the majority of survivors make a good recovery [2]. Nevertheless, PAD and long\u2010term disability are associated with the type of stroke and location within the brain (see Table\u00a01).\n\nTable 1 Stroke classification.

between 1 cm to 2 cm ; and greater than 2 cm .\nthe efficacy of gadobenate dimeglumine enhanced mri was evaluated by assessing the change in detection ( relative to the reference standard ) from pre - contrast mri to contrast enhanced mri .\nthe change in concordance with the reference standard from unenhanced to enhanced mri in the determination of the number of focal liver lesions was tested using a two tailed mcnemars test .\ndifferences in concordance were also studied between concentrations and imaging times using a two tailed mcnemars test . because all patients were selected on the basis of lesion pathology , specificity and accuracy could not be assessed .\nthe number of focal liver lesions identified on gd - bopta enhanced mr images exceeded the number identified on unenhanced images ( table 1 ) .\ntable 1 separates the number of lesions identified by reviewer by time point as well as by imaging sequence . by combining both the t1-weighted gre and t1-weighted se images before and after contrast ( both early and late time points ) for reviewers a ,\nb and c , the number of lesions identified increased after contrast administration from 34 to 53 , 37 to 48 , and 43 to 49 , respectively .\nthere was no significant difference in lesion detection between the two concentrations ( 0.05 mmol \/ kg and 0.10 mmol \/ kg ) of contrast administered .\ntable 1 shows that , in general , more lesions were identified with the t1-weighted gre pulse sequence when compared to the t1-weighted se technique , and more lesions were identified after contrast administration when both imaging techniques were analyzed together .\nmost lesions were identified on the late imaging time point ( 90 - 120 minutes ) although several more lesions ( total number ) were identified combining both the early and late post - contrast images .\nthe number of false positive lesions decreased for two of the three reviewers after the administration of gd - bopta ( table 2 ) .\none reviewer detected all of these lesions while the other two reviewers detected 14 out of 15 solitary lesions .\nthere were 5 patients with 2 lesions ; both lesions were identified only after contrast administration in 4 of the 5 patients . in the remaining patient with two lesions , the second lesion ( 25 mm ) was not identified before or after contrast . in two of these patients gadobenate dimeglumine administration allowed identification of the second lesion while in the other two patients , gd - bopta administration was required for the visualization of both ( fig .\none lesion was identified before and after gadobenate dimeglumine in all of these patients ; however , the second and third lesions were only identified by one of the reviewers in one patient and two reviewers in another patient . in the third patient with three lesions ,\ntwo out of three reviewers detected more lesions after contrast administration in 6 out of these 8 patients ( fig 2 ) . in the remaining two patients , one patient had no additional lesions identified while only 1 out of the 3 reviewers detected more lesions after contrast in the other patient . in 68% of the patients with more than one lesion by reference standard ( 11 of 16 patients ) ,\nafter contrast administration , smaller lesions were better detected by two of the three reviewers ( table 3 ) . from a total of 29 lesions smaller than 1 cm ,\nthe number of lesions detected before and after contrast infusion for reviewers a , b , and c where 7 to 21 , 9 to 15 , and 16 to 18 respectively .\nthis was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) for only two of the three reviewers ( fig 3 ) . the number of lesions detected for both the 1 - 2 cm and greater than 2 cm group also increased after contrast administration .\nthis study shows that gadobenate dimeglumine enhanced t1-weighted mr imaging can improve the detection of primary hepatic malignant neoplasms .\nour findings confirm prior reports that have noted improvement in lesion - liver contrast on gd - bopta enhanced images .\nfurthermore , our findings show that the most important benefit is in the detection of small ( less than 1 cm ) tumors .\nprior reports have provided conflicting findings on contrast enhanced mr imaging using hepatocyte targeted contrast agents in patients with cirrhosis .\nfor example , murakami et al . noted that compared to normal liver , patients with cirrhosis had lower hepatic enhancement with mn - dpdp ( 9 ) while manfredi et al\n. reported similar enhancement between normal and cirrhotic livers with gadobenate dimeglumine ( 6 ) .\nthese differences may be due to variations in the severity of cirrhosis in the subject groups or due to differences in pharmacokinetics of the two drugs as gd - bopta also shows non - specific tissue enhancement ( extracellular effect ) in addition to hepatocyte specific liver enhancement .\nour results have important implications with respect to imaging technique and the evaluation of patients with primary hepatic neoplasms .\nfirstly t1-weighted gre techniques were superior compared to se techniques and there was only minimal improvement in the total number of lesions detected when both sequences were used together .\nprior studies have in fact reported that quantitative measurement of liver - to - lesion contrast on t1-weighted gre images is superior to that on se images ( 17 ) .\nthis advantage is most likely related to greater t1-weighting on the gre images due to the availability of shorter tes and to decreased motion - related noise in these breath - hold images .\nthese images can also be obtained at thinner section ( 8 mm ) with ample coverage to study the entire liver . while use of fatsaturation may also provide additional benefit , this was not studied and requires future attention ( 18 ) . in terms of the optimal imaging window\n, it appears there is a favorable distinction between liver and primary malignant hepatic neoplasms at both the early and late time points after gadobenate dimeglumine administration although slightly more total lesions were detected at the late time point ( 90 - 120 minutes after injection ) .\nthere was no significant difference in lesion detection between the two doses ( 0.05 mmol \/ kg and 0.10 mmol \/ kg ) evaluated .\none possible way to image with this agent is to initially perform dynamic imaging immediately following the pre - contrast examination ( not performed in these cases ) and then , if needed , have the patient return at a convenient time between 1 - 2 hours later to have delayed scans performed .\nthis approach may not only increase the yield in lesion detection in patients with cirrhosis where dynamic scanning is known to be of critical importance , but may also provide important perfusion data for tissue characterization .\nmoreover , this approach may well be the preferred procedure in patients suspected of harboring liver metastases .\nin such patients , dynamic imaging with conventional gadolinium agents does not necessarily improve lesion detectability over unenhanced scans alone ( 19 - 20 ) .\nthis did not allow determination of accuracy , sensitivity or specificity since there was an unintentional bias as the reviewers expected to identify at least one hepatic mass .\nin addition the off - site analysis methodology may also have biased the results against gd - bopta since clinical information may have improved diagnostic performance was not available . furthermore , the presence of cirrhosis was not proven in all subjects ; it is likely that this patient population represented a spectrum of underlying chronic liver disease and extrapolation to a cirrhotic population should be made with caution .\nanother limitation was that even though histological diagnosis was available for all the patients , not every lesion was sampled .\nfinally , comparison of this agent to contrast - enhanced helical ct may also be necessary to determine the clinical utility of gadobenate dimeglumine enhanced liver mr imaging .\nclinical utility may also be affected by the fact that the t2-weighted images were not utilized for the evaluation of the images .\nthis methodology was adopted in order to best evaluate the effect of the contrast agent on t1-weighted images . however , in actual practice , patients would not be evaluated without simultaneous review of the t2-weighted images . in conclusion ,\ngd - bopta may serve a role as a contrast agent to identify primary malignant hepatic neoplasms with mr imaging . from our\nblinded off - site multicenter evaluation , the contrast agent aids in the detection of smaller lesions in a patient group where traditional imaging ( us , ct , mr ) has been limited .","abstract":" objectiveto investigate the efficacy of gadobenate dimeglumine ( gd - bopta ) enhanced mr imaging for the detection of liver lesions in patients with primary malignant hepatic neoplasms.materials and methodsthirty - one patients with histologically proven primary malignancy of the liver were evaluated before and after administration of gd - bopta at dose 0.05 or 0.10 mmol \/ kg . \n t1-weighted spin echo ( t1w - se ) and gradient echo ( t1w - gre ) images were evaluated for lesion number , location , size and confidence by three off - site independent reviewers and the findings were compared to reference standard imaging ( intraoperative ultrasound , computed tomography during arterial portography or lipiodol computed tomography ) . \n results were analyzed for significance using a two - sided mcnemar 's test.resultsmore lesions were identified on gd - bopta enhanced images than on unenhanced images and there was no significant difference in lesion detection between either concentration . \n the largest benefit was in detection of lesions under 1 cm in size ( 7 to 21 , 9 to 15 , 16 to 18 for reviewers a , b , c respectively ) . in 68% of the patients with more than one lesion , \n gd - bopta increased the number of lesions detected.conclusionliver mr imaging after gd - bopta increases the detection of liver lesions in patients with primary malignant hepatic neoplasm .

{"article":"success in a root canal treatment depends on the complete removal of canal content through mechanical instrumentation , on the accurate disinfection of the endodontic space by chemical agents followed by an adequate three - dimensional obturation.1 gutta - percha in association with different endodontic sealers has been used for long time as a traditional root canal obturation system.2 several studies indicated that resin based endodontic sealers exhibit superior sealing ability by adhesion to root - canal walls.35 in recent years different resin based dual - cure endodontic sealers were introduced to the clinical practice.6 endorez ( ultradent , south jordan , ut ) is a urethane dimethacrylate - based dual curing self priming sealer .\none of its prime characteristic properties is a high hydrophilicity , allowing the penetration of the material into the dentinal tubules.7 this sealer exhibits a good biocompatibility and performs successfully when used as an endodontic sealer together with gutta - percha cones in clinical cases.8,9 endorez is also compatible when bonding techniques are used , but it polymerizes within 2030 minutes , therefore if the immediate restoration of the tooth is the objective of treatment , the use of a dimethyl - p - toluidine - based accelerator ( ultradent , south jordan , ut ) to be used in conjunction with the sealer has been suggested.10 determination of the degree of conversion ( dc ) of methacrylate monomers to polymer may be used to evaluate the status of polymerization .\nthe dc indicates the percentage of monomer - polymer conversion and is both a quantitative and qualitative index of the extent of the polymerization ( ep).11 differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) is a thermal analysis technique that provides the variation of enthalpy in the exothermic reaction of polymerization ; thus allowing the examination of the behaviour of the materials tested by means of thermal and physical characterizations.12 this exam can be run using small masses of the samples to test11 with many advantages : 1 ) sharper and well defined peaks ; 2 ) less drift from the basis line ; 3 ) a linear proportionality relation between the mass of the specimen and the area under the peak .\ndsc is also a convenient method for determining the relative efficacy of the initiator systems,11,13 inhibitors11 or activators at the end of the polymerization of a given material .\na current problem using some resin based endodontic sealers is their long setting time,14,15 probably due to their increased viscosity that may influence the initial reaction rate in the photopolymerization system .\nthe aim of this study was to determine with the dsc , the dc of three different resin based endodontic sealer systems : endorez ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; realseal ( sybronendo , orange , ca , usa ) ; and endorez in association with the accelerator ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) , activated with two different led units : ultralume led 5 ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; mini led satelec ( satelec acteon group , mrignac cedex , france ) .\nin this study three resin based endodontic sealers were used : endorez ( er ) ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; endorez modified with the addition of a dimethyl - p - toluidine - based accelerator ( er+a ) ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; realseal ( rs ) ( sybronendo , orange , ca , usa ) .\nrealseal is an endodontic dual curable resin sealer , whose matrix is a mixture of bisphenol - a - glycidyl methacrylate , ethoxylate bis - gma , urethane dimethacrylate resin and hydrophilic difunctional matacrylates.16 two different led light units were used to activate each sealer : ultralume led 5 ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; mini led satelec ( satelec acteon group , mrignac cedex , france ) .\nultralume led 5 lamp produces light with wavelengths between 370 and 500 nm and a light intensity of 800 mw \/ cm .\nmini led lamp has a wavelengths range between 420 and 480 nm and it generates a light intensity of 1250 mw \/ cm . in this study we did nt use a radiometer to measure the light intensity of these brand new led light sources employed , because these parameters were certified by the manufacturers .\nsix groups , of three samples each , were therefore created as follows : au ( er + ultralume led 5 ) ; bu ( rs + ultralume led 5 ) ; cu ( er + accelerator + ultralume led 5 ) ; am ( er + mini led ) ; bm ( rs + mini led ) ; cm ( er + accelerator + mini led ) . a differential scanning calorimeter dsc 7 ( perkin elmer inc . ,\nwellesley , ma , usa ) was used to evaluate the degree of conversion ( dc ) of methacrylate monomers to polymer in each specimen .\nthe control ( an empty aluminium pan , called  white  ) , was prepared before dsc measurements , weighed with an analytic balance , placed in the reference sample holder and then irradiated with the same light units at the same conditions fixed for the sealers .\nthe exposure of the  white  served to evaluate the heat flow from the lamps .\nspecimens were set into previously calibrated dsc standard aluminium pans (  4.52 mm ) , and weighed using the analytic balance to obtain 4.14.2 mg for each material . to prepare the specimen consisting of er with the accelerator ,\na thin layer of accelerator was applied uniformly on the base of each capsule with a micro - brush , then the sealer was placed to fill the capsule until the whole weight of the sample was reached as for all the other specimens .\na custom - made support was built to hold the lamps in a fixed position during polymerization , in order to assure the reproducibility of the dsc measurements , to fully irradiate only the specimen - containing pan , and to keep the distance lamp - specimen constant .\nin addition each lamp was inserted inside an isolation cylinder to avoid the dispersion of the beam .\nthe photo curing units were used by two different polymerization protocols depending on the unit ( standard mode for the ultralume led 5 , and ramping mode for the mini led ) .\neach sample was photopolymerized with 4 irradiations of 20 s each ( the minimum exposure time to obtain an adequate cure)17 at 2 min .\ninterval from each other ( this time is necessary to exclude the thermal effect of optical fibres ) .\nthe dsc to measure the enthalpy of polymerization was programmed under isothermal conditions at 32c , under constant flowing argon environment ( 10 ml \/ min ) to avoid oxidation during the polymerization . after the specimen containing pans were placed in the sample holder , the temperature\nwas immediately increased to 32c ( a process taking 20 s ) , to start the measurement of the heat flow .\nthe isothermal measurements were therefore always started exactly 2 min after the initial placement of the materials on the aluminium pan so that all the sealers were tested under the same conditions .\nthe heat flow in the dsc was calculated by considering the exact initial weight of the specimens since all the data from each sample were recorded in the software supplied with dsc 7 at the beginning of the experiment .\nthe heat flow generated during the polymerization reaction was recorded and graphically represented in a kinetic curve by means of the dsc 7 software .\nthe heat of the exothermic reaction obtained from the dsc of each specimen of sealer represented the sum of the exothermic effects caused by the conversion of the monomers and heat flow from the lamp ; while the scanning of the  white  ( control ) represented only the irradiation heat output from the lamp.18 the heat of polymerization developed during the test of the  white  was thus subtracted to calculate the heat of polymerization of the specimens .\nenthalpy was calculated from the area under the peak of the isothermal curve , based on the extrapolated baseline at the end of the reaction .\nthe released heat is proportional to the percentage of reacted monomers.19 if the cure reaction is the only thermal event , then the reaction rate is proportional to the heat flow.20 the kinetic data was elaborated with a kaleida - graph software system ( version 4.0 , 2005 , synergy software , reading , pa 19606 , usa ) .\na dc value of 100% was attributed to er + a , which is the sample with maximum enthalpy observed , and the relative degree of conversion of the other sealers was calculated using this as a reference .\nthe degree of conversion (  ) was calculated using the following formula : \n sample=(qssample \/ qser+a)100where qs   and qs   correspond respectively to the values of enthalpy of the sample to test and the sample er + a used as a reference .\neach group was tested for four repeated irradiation times considering the following factors : material , type of light - curing unit and duration of exposure .\nkruskal - wallis one - way anova multiple range test was performed at a p value of .05 .\nstudent - newman - keuls ( snk ) test at a p level of .05 was then applied to identify pairwise differences .\nrepresentative relative values of the degree of conversion as a function of irradiation time measured for the materials tested , irradiated with ultralume led 5 and mini led are respectively shown in figure 1 a , b , c .\nthe results are as follows : \n samples tested with ultralume led 5 : group cu showed a degree of conversion significantly higher compared with the other sealers ; no statistical differences were found between groups au and bu ( figure 1a).samples tested with mini led : statistically significant differences were observed between relative dc of all the materials tested , with the highest values for group cm and the lowest recorded values for group bm ( figure 1b ) .\nsamples tested with ultralume led 5 : group cu showed a degree of conversion significantly higher compared with the other sealers ; no statistical differences were found between groups au and bu ( figure 1a ) .\nsamples tested with mini led : statistically significant differences were observed between relative dc of all the materials tested , with the highest values for group cm and the lowest recorded values for group bm ( figure 1b ) .\ntherefore , the values of enthalpy of the groups er + accelerator ( cm and cu ) among the specimens polymerized were higher when compared to the other resin materials tested with the same lamp ( figure 2a ) .\nrelative dc values were calculated for each specimen as a function of the irradiation time using as only reference the highest value obtained with ultralume led 5 for the specimen er + a ( cu ) to which was attributed 100% of value .\nthen the relative degree of conversion values were calculated for each specimen using as only reference the highest value obtained with mini led for the specimen er + a ( cm ) to which was attributed 100% of value .\nassuming that the heat of reaction corresponds to the extent of the polymerization ( ep ) obtained , statistically significant differences in the degree of conversion were observed in the pairwise comparison between the materials tested and the sealers prepared with the addition of the catalyst . according to the data recorded for each material the group cm ( er + accelerator + mini led ) showed the highest values of enthalpy followed ( in decreasing values of enthalpy ) by these groups : am ( er + mini led ) , bm ( rs + mini led ) , cu ( er + accelerator + ultralume led 5 ) , bu ( rs + ultralume led 5 ) , au ( er + ultralume led 5 ) ( table 1 ) .\nthe use of the mini led produced values of enthalpy of reaction higher than those produced with the ultralume led 5 in all the materials tested .\nfigure 1c is representative of relative dc values calculated for each specimen as a function of irradiation time using as only reference the highest value of enthalpy obtained for the specimen er + a + mini led .\nstatistically significant differences were observed among the behaviour of all the specimens with the exception of cu \/ bm and au \/ bu ( table 1 ) .\nafter the first irradiation all materials tested showed a similar behaviour regarding enthalpy values , which decreased relatively slowly after the successive irradiations and reached a plateau between the third and the fourth irradiation time ( figure 2b ) . among the materials tested with the same lamp , er+a showed the best values of enthalpy produced after the first irradiation time ( figure 2b ) which correspond to a higher conversion than that obtained in the other sealers after 20 s of irradiation time .\nin this study we evaluated the polymerization status of two methacrylate - based resin sealers , both self and photo - curing , that are used for root canal obturation : endorez and realseal.21,22 we also investigated the behaviour of endorez used with an accelerator .\nthe ultimate properties of dental resins are directly related both to the chemical composition of the dental monomer system and to the degree of its conversion ( dc ) to polymer.11 in general the dc influences the mechanical - physical properties and clinical performance of dental resins as it has been underlined by many studies , including compressive strength , flexural strength , hardness and wear.23 two other phenomena connected with the polymerization of the resins are volumetric shrinkage and heating.24 the adequacy of the polymerization is influenced by many factors such as the distance of the light source from the resin ; the type of resin ( shade , translucency and thickness , viscosity);25 the temperature ; the curing and post - irradiation time;24,26 the reactivity of the monomer ; the types and amounts of inhibitors , the light ; the oxygen permeability27 and also the type and amount of photo initiator \/ co - initiator systems.13,28 it has also been shown that dynamic heating of the resin samples increases the rate of polymerization resulting in higher conversion.29,30 in our study we tested the materials in isothermal conditions . we used dsc because it is one of the most reliable direct methods for analyzing the degree of conversion of resin blends and the kinetics of the curing reaction.18 dsc determines the dc based on the assumption that the heat produced during the reaction ( enthalpy ) is proportional to the percentage of monomers that have reacted.13,19 in addition the enthalpy makes it possible to study how different combinations of photo - initiator and coinitiator systems , or a specific activator , affect the final cure when different light sources are used.13 in this study we also determined the conversion level as a function of the irradiation time .\nadequate polymerization of dental resins depends also on the intensity of the light source ( power density measured in mw \/ cm ) , correct wavelength of the light and duration of the exposure.25,26 if these parameters are not adequate an incomplete polymerization will occur , together with the exhibition of poor physical properties of the material , higher solubility and consequently an early failure.31 in our experiment we used ultralume led 5 and mini led .\nlight emitting diodes ( led ) units produce light with wavelengths between 450 and 490 nm with a peak at 460 nm : this energy range is nearly ideal for activating materials that employ camphorquinone as a photoactivator ; therefore leds require less power to operate . in addition led units have an extended life and produce less heat thus respecting pulp and gingival tissue.25,31 dental resins cured with blue leds show a larger depth of cure , a higher dc and more stable three - dimensional structures than those cured using halogen lamps.32 in this experiment the values of conversion of the endorez + accelerator system were the highest of all materials tested , both with ultralume led 5 and mini led lamp .\nin addition , among the materials tested with the same lamp , endorez + accelerator showed the highest values of enthalpy after the first irradiation time ( 20 s ) . with regard to the groups where endorez + accelerator was tested , the type of led light unit employed did not influence the experimental results in terms of polymerization rate when compared to the other resin materials tested . according to our results relative\ndc progressively increased in all the specimens tested from the first to the fourth irradiation .\nfurther irradiations after the first light exposure of 20 s contributed to increase the percentage of cured monomers .\nendorez with or without accelerator and realseal polymerized with the mini led showed a better behaviour than the same sealers polymerized with the ultralume led 5 : this was probably due to the major intensity of the light source .\nrealseal polymerised with the ultralume led 5 showed values of conversion from the second to the fourth irradiation that were higher than those obtained from the endorez polymerized with the same lamp , but these differences were not statistically significant .\nin the group realseal + mini led at each irradiation time the conversion was significantly lower than that recorded for the group endorez + mini led , and the values of enthalpy were almost constant during all the polymerization .\nthe different behaviour among the materials tested may be due to their different components , such as photo initiators , that allow a different response of the material to the irradiation .\nit was not possible to use the same curing mode for the two light units .\nhowever in consideration of the exponential increase of the dc as a function of irradiation time , we did not expect significant differences among the two curing modes . in this study\nwe evaluated the differences in dc of the sealers considering the overall characteristics of the led light units . during the interval between each irradiation the materials did not exhibit significant exothermic signals , thus indicating that the auto - polymerization was very slow and did not influence this experiment .\nthe sample preparation consisting of er with the accelerator was meant to reflect the situation that occurs in the endodontic system where the contact of the activator with er interests only the interface of the sealer with the gutta - percha cones that are immersed into the accelerator before their placement in the canal previously filled with the endorez .\nthe higher values of dc exhibited by endorez used in conjunction with the accelerator has a clinical relevance because it decreases the setting time of the material making it possible to complete the restoration of the tooth in one visit .\nit has also several advantages in terms of increasing the mechanical properties of the material ( obturation stability , durability and performance after initial polymerization ) .\nit must be considered that a higher polymerization corresponds to a major shrinkage of the resin , which may represent an important cause of microleakage : in a recent study , higher leakage was found when using endorez sealer with accelerator than endorez alone in delayed post space preparation.10,33 on the other hand the placement of many accessory cones , as the surface of the canal allows , reduces the amount of sealer , resulting in less polymerization shrinkage . if the immediate completion of the restoration of a tooth is the objective , then the accelerator should be used .\nin the methacrylate - based sealers after light activation residual unreacted monomers continue to react slowly even at body temperature . as\nthese unreacted monomers are responsible for the biological response to the material,26,34,35 we deduce that an increase in the degree of conversion can reduce the cytotoxicity of the sealers . in this\nstudy the reactions of polymerization resulted not complete following the first irradiation time : the dc progressively increased as a function of the irradiation and its values after each subsequent irradiation contributed to a reduction of the percentage of unreacted monomers .\ntherefore the results of our experiment are qualitatively in accordance with the study of mazinis and lambrianides , according to which there s not correlation between setting time and setting conversion of endodontic sealers as the setting conversion of the material continues after the setting time ( that is the time when the material harden).14\naccording to the results obtained in this study , it could be concluded that : \n either using mini led or ultralume led 5 as light unit , endorez in association with the accelerator exhibits significantly higher values of dc than endorez and realseal , both without catalysts;the use of the mini led produced higher dc than the ultralume led 5 , both in the endorez with or without accelerator and in the realseal;the relative dc progressively increased in all the specimens tested from the first to the fourth irradiation;only further studies can evaluate if the use of endorez with the addition of the accelerator may represent an advantage or a disadvantage for its clinical use .\neither using mini led or ultralume led 5 as light unit , endorez in association with the accelerator exhibits significantly higher values of dc than endorez and realseal , both without catalysts ; the use of the mini led produced higher dc than the ultralume led 5 , both in the endorez with or without accelerator and in the realseal ; the relative dc progressively increased in all the specimens tested from the first to the fourth irradiation ; only further studies can evaluate if the use of endorez with the addition of the accelerator may represent an advantage or a disadvantage for its clinical use .","abstract":" objectives : the aim of this study was to determine the degree of conversion ( dc ) of three resin based endodontic sealers using the dsc technique.methods:the sealers tested were : endorez ( er ) ( ultradent , south jordan , ut ) ; endorez with accelerator ( er+a ) ( ultradent , south jordan , ut ) ; realseal ( rs ) ( sybronendo , orange , ca ) . \n two led units were used to activate the sealers : ultralume led 5 ( ultradent , south jordan , ut , usa ) ; mini led satelec ( satelec acteon group , mrignac cedex , france ) . \n samples of 4.0 mg were analyzed with a dsc 7 calorimeter ( perkin elmer inc . , \n wellesley , ma , us ) . \n each specimen was irradiated by each lamp four times for 20 seconds at an interval of 2 mins , while the dsc 7 recorded the heat flow developed during the treatment . \n the degree of conversion and the kinetic curves were calculated from the values of heat developed during each polymerization . \n the data were statistically analysed with a kruskal -

{"article":"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is a respiratory condition with clinical manifestations that affect not only the quality of life and prognosis but also the overall health of the patient.1 consequently , care of copd patients should comply with the clinical guidelines to ensure optimal clinical care.2 in this context , clinical audits have emerged as a tool to measure clinical activity and benchmark it against known clinical standards.3 previous clinical audits in copd care have shown variability in clinical practices across hospitals and countries after adjusting for different confounders.4 interestingly , weather changes considerably affect chronic respiratory diseases.5 various respiratory conditions , including asthma6 and cystic fibrosis,7 are known to exacerbate during winter . in copd , especially , the number of exacerbations rises during winter months,8 with an increase in the number of admissions and readmissions,9 and the corresponding implications on treatment selection.10 additionally , respiratory virus infection is more common in the winter and virus - associated exacerbations take longer to recover from.11 consequently , clinical practice in copd care can be influenced by weather variability throughout the year .\nunfortunately , the effect of different seasons on clinical practice in copd care has not been evaluated thus far , and previous clinical audits have not taken into account the climatic changes and their potential effect on clinical care . in spain , the weather varies from very high temperatures and high pressures during the summer to considerably cold winter months with temperatures reaching < 0 in some areas , warranting an investigation on the influence of climatic changes on clinical care for copd . during the period 20132014 ,\na clinical audit was conducted on copd outpatients of hospitals in andalusia , spain ( more than 8 million inhabitants).12 the present study analyzes the results of this andalusian copd audit with regard to potential seasonal changes in clinical practice , in order to explore the hypothesis of seasonal variability in copd clinical care throughout the year .\nthe andalusian copd audit was a pilot clinical audit conducted from october 2013 to september 2014 in outpatient respiratory clinics of hospitals in andalusia , spain ( 8 provinces with more than 8 million inhabitants ) .\nthe methodology used has been extensively reported previously.12 in brief , 20% of the centers in the area were invited to participate in this audit .\nthe selection of centers was based on participation in previous audits and was voluntary . as it was a pilot study ,\nrandomization was not performed , and therefore , we did not aim to achieve representative sampling .\npatients with an established copd diagnosis based on risk factors , clinical symptoms , and a post - bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second \/ forced vital capacity ( fev1\/fvc ) ratio < 0.70 were deemed to be eligible.13 as our goal was to assess the usefulness of formally scheduled regular follow - up visits , only cases with at least 1 year of follow - up were included in the audit .\npatients who underwent their first diagnostic visit or presented with an exacerbation were not eligible .\nsimilarly , subjects with significant respiratory comorbidities that could influence copd treatment approach were excluded according to the local investigator s discretion . based on our previous experience\n, we estimated that 80 cases per center would be required for this pilot study .\nrecruitment for the 1-year audit was performed in 4 quarters ( october  december 2013 , january  march 2014 , april \nseptember 2014 ) . at the beginning of each trimester , investigators were instructed to identify consecutive copd cases until the desired sample size of 20 per trimester was reached .\nthe clinical practice of outpatient clinics was bench - marked against the clinical guidelines available at the time of the audit . during the study period ,\nthe gold 201313 and the spanish national guideline for copd ( gesepoc)14 were widely and uniformly used in spain .\nwe , therefore , carefully reviewed these 2 guidelines to extract relevant clinical recommendations for benchmarking the clinical practices audited .\nwe also considered the guidelines of the 2009 spain health - care quality standards in copd , which were applicable at the time of the audit.15 the final database included 55 variables for the resources and 182 variables for the clinical database . among the items\nevaluated , it was verified whether doctors assessed the patient satisfaction with the inhaler . for this purpose , investigators were asked whether the degree of satisfaction with the inhalation device was recorded during the clinical visit with 2 possible answers : yes or no . for the present analysis ,\nthus , december 21 to march 20 was considered winter , march 21 to june 20 was spring , june 21 to september 20 was summer , and september 21 to december 20 was autumn .\nthe audit was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital universitario virgen del roco ( code : 2013pi\/201 ) .\nclinical records were anonymized in the database by assigning a numerical code through an algorithm .\nno personal information that could be used directly or indirectly to identify an individual was registered .\nthe relationship between the audit code and the clinical history number was kept local and was the local investigator s responsibility .\nbecause of the retrospective nature of the study , the anonymization of data , and the lack of active diagnostic or therapeutic interventions , informed consents were not required according to the ethics committee of the hospital universitario virgen del roco .\nall computations were performed using the statistical package for social sciences , version 23.0 ( spss ; ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) . before performing any analysis , the database was evaluated for quality .\nthe values that were extreme from a clinical point of view , missing , or inconsistent were returned to the investigators for correction .\nclinical variables are presented as the mean and standard deviations or absolute and relative frequencies , as appropriate for displaying the results of the entire cohort and dividing them by seasons .\nthe variability was expressed by using the interhospital range , which represents the highest and lowest mean value from the participant centers .\nthe significance of this variability was explored using the chi -

to - severe lung function impairment were noted .\nthe distribution of the information obtained during the clinical interview over the 4 seasons is presented in table 2 .\nthe occurrence of dyspnea recorded using the modified medical research council ( mmrc ) scale and the copd assessment test increased in winter ; sputum color and hospitalizations were recorded less frequently in autumn and increased in summer . during autumn ,\nthe recording of previous exacerbations , smoking status , inhaler device satisfaction , and adverse effects decreased , whereas the recording of the current pharmacological strategy increased .\nthe different complementary diagnostic evaluations requested during the 4 seasons are presented in table 3 .\nonly the measurement of serum 1-antitrypsin level was found to be influenced by the seasons , with a decrease in spring .\nthe final treatment - related recommendations after the follow - up visit during the 4 seasons are presented in table 4 .\nonly the decision as to whether to discharge the patient from the clinic was influenced by the season , with an increase during the summertime .\nafter adjusting for covariates , only the assessment of inhaler device satisfaction was found to significantly differ according to seasons with an increase in winter ( or , 3.460 ; 95% ci , 1.4698.151 ) , spring ( or , 4.215 ; 95% ci , 1.8149.793 ) , and summer ( or , 3.371 ; 95% ci , 1.3918.169 ) compared to autumn .\nnotably , inhaler device satisfaction was low in the majority of centers ( table 2 ) , peaking at 60.5% in 1 center .\nin fact , those seasons with device satisfaction more frequently recorded reached an average maximum of 21.5% .\nthe rest of the observed differences were not significant when adjusted for covariates ( data not shown ) .\nthe andalusian copd audit was the first to evaluate the quality of care in copd treatment in specialized respiratory outpatient clinics .\nthe results of the study showed that after controlling for confounders , there is no relationship between seasons and clinical practice .\nthe analysis of clinical performance against the recommended care has provided relevant information on how care is provided to copd patients.16 clinical audits are conceived as a tool to summarize the clinical performance of health care over a specified period of time and are aimed at providing information to health care professionals to allow them to assess and adjust their performance.17 although clinical performance has been extensively studied during copd admissions,18,19 the situation in outpatient clinics has been mainly evaluated in the andalusian copd audit,12 providing information on clinicians adherence to guidelines16 and pharmacological treatment performance.20 previous studies have evaluated the rates of adherence to gold guidelines for copd treatment among pulmonologists ; however , these studies focus exclusively on pharmacological treatments.2123 in the present study , we evaluated a typical follow - up clinical visit , and thus , in turn , determined the degree to which the doctor in - charge follows and records the recommended information , highlighting the variability of performance throughout the different seasons . in order to interpret our results correctly , some considerations need to be made .\nthis implies that there was no randomization of centers , and that the variables included were not all possible .\naccordingly , randomization of a center in wider geographical areas and a comprehensive evaluation of different variables and clinical outcomes would improve the representativeness of the sample .\nafter this first experience , we identify the need to confirm our findings in a nationally representative audit , expanding the area studied and increasing the number of variables .\n2 ) it is important to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on clinically relevant outcomes . accordingly , a follow - up of patients is needed to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on exacerbation rates and survival .\n3 ) there are potential intrinsic limitations resulting from different auditors evaluating different medical records . to avoid this\n, we analyzed the database looking for missing , extreme , or inconsistent values , and such values were returned to the investigators for correction .\n4 ) finally , although global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment , resulting in a significant increase in the morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic lung disease24 and increased prevalence of certain respiratory diseases;25 due to the slow progression of climate change and global warming , 1 year is probably insufficient to evaluate the effect of climate change on clinical practice . therefore , the present study does not aim to evaluate the effect of global warming on clinical practice but only studies possible variations in copd care in a year .\nsignificant year - to - year variations in climate conditions within a particular geographical area might affect our results .\nin addition , climate differences among the different areas in the country might also have an effect .\nalthough andalusia has extreme temperatures ranging from very high temperatures and high pressures during the summer to considerably cold winter months with temperatures reaching < 0 , other parts of spain may get colder during the year .\ntherefore , the results might have been different if the study would have been carried out in a region with more extreme climate changes throughout the year .\nwe are currently analyzing the results of a nationwide clinical audit that will allow us to analyze seasonal variation in the country .\nthe results of the present analysis indicate that clinicians do not alter their clinical practice according to the seasons .\na recent body of evidence has shown the variation in symptom perception by patients during the 24 hours of a day.26,27 however , although there is information on the distribution of exacerbation during the seasons,28 very little information is available regarding the variability of symptoms during a year .\nalthough 1 study has focused on the effect of seasons on physical activity,29 the majority of the evidence shows that exacerbations increase during the cold months.30 however , in a stable state , there is little evidence of an association between the seasons and the symptoms perceived by patients .\nshould this association exist , it would result in an expected change in clinical performance across seasons .\nhowever , the differences found here are explained by the severity of the disease , indicating that this is the main driver of clinical decisions rather than the seasons .\na recent analysis of the same database indicated that exacerbations and symptoms were the main factors for stepping up treatment , and fev1 and previous treatment with long - term antibiotics or inhaled steroids were the key determinants for stepping down treatment.20 thus , our data suggest that clinicians adapt their performance in accordance with clinical manifestations rather than the time of the year .\nthe association of inhaler device satisfaction with respect to the seasons has not been described previously .\nbecause of the pilot nature of the study , the number of variables was limited .\naccordingly , a detailed evaluation of inhaler satisfaction was not included in the audit , and investigators were only asked to check whether the degree of satisfaction with the inhalation device was recorded during the clinical visit . clearly , adherence evaluation and inhaler device satisfaction are crucial for a chronic respiratory condition .\nmany studies have highlighted the importance of treatment adherence and a correct inhaler technique in copd.31 patients satisfaction with the inhaler has been associated with compliance and health status in copd,32 where the role of the doctor in -

, and the \n results indicate that the trapezius muscle plays a major role in fixing head movement during \n study or work performed using desks and chairs .\nthe result can also be interpreted as \n showing that the trapezius muscle is used to maintain fixed posture because of movement of \n the head location , due to desk and chair design , which determine the direction of the gaze \n while in a

that segment are not bigger than the other muscles . \n\nthis situation can easily cause fatigue during maintenance of posture , and furthermore , can \n cause diseases such as spinal disk disease .\ntherefore , the stability of the head segment is \n important , especially in a sitting posture which involves maintenance of posture for a long \n period , and the lower the level of the forward tilt of the head , the less the level of \n fatigue due to decreased fatigue of the muscles supporting the head25 . in general , head movement is known to induce more instability than hip movement in terms of \n physical balance26 . for students who \n spend many hours studying using a desk and a chair , the use of the acds , which can decrease \n the forward tilt of the head and trunk , would help to increase their studying capacity by \n reducing study - related fatigue .\nthe authors also believe that it would also be effective at \n reducing the risk to the cervical spine of incurring

a group with head and neck \n pain had a forward head tilt that was 4.8 less than that of a group without pain , thus \n indicating a correlation between forward tilt of the head and pain of the head and neck11 .\nit was also reported that a chair \n offering backward tilt was more comfortable a in a study of backrest angles for work \n comfort10 , and a chair angle supporting \n a horizontal gaze

a horizontal gaze is more effective at maintaining relative comfort when studying \n for a long time using a desk and a chair . to obtain that goal\nalthough \n the forward tilt of the head of the ncds subjects increased in ncds after 120 minutes of \n studying in the present study , the acds subjects showed a relative decrease in the \n horizontal length change of the head to c7 and the head to t12 after 2 hour of study , and \n decreased forward tilt of the head and trunk was observed .\nkorean students generally study for a long time while sitting on a chair with a horizontal \n desk .\nthis posture eventually increases the forward tilt of the head , thus making the \n trapezius muscles continuously perform eccentric contractions to prevent forward tilt , \n causing increase in

{"article":"in 1970 , a 51-yr - old female with apparent celiac disease was recorded with refractory malabsorption.10 an unusual histological abnormality in the small intestine was described consisting of an eosinophilic sub - epithelial hyaline - like material in the lamina propria .\nthe deposits had histochemical staining characteristics of collagen , and ultra - structural studies confirmed the presence of an electron - dense material with the characteristic 640 . a axial periodicity of collagen fibers .\nlater reports described severe and long - standing malabsorption with diarrhea and progressive weight loss , flattened small intestinal villous architecture , and these same distinctive sub - epithelial collagen deposits .\nsome felt that the collagen deposits simply represented a prognostic marker of a poor outcome in celiac disease.11 others considered the disorder to be an entirely new , previously unrecognized , entity poorly responsive to a gluten - free diet.12 both entities share many common elements .\nhyposplenism and positive endomysial antibodies have been detected in both disorders.13 moreover , some complications ordinarily associated with celiac disease have been associated with collagneous sprue .\nsmall intestinal ulceration and perforation may develop.14 atypical immunohistochemical changes with gene rearrangement defined by polymerase chain reaction reported in refractory sprue ( or sprue - like intestinal disease ) have been noted in collagenous sprue.14,15 malignant lymphoma may develop during the clinical course of collagenous sprue.14,16,17 as in celiac disease , both t - cell lymphoma16 and b - cell lymphoma17 have been recorded in collagenous sprue\n. the natural history of collagenous sprue has been characterized by continued malabsorption , usually of multiple nutrients , and a lethal outcome .\nsome recent reports , however , with extensive biopsy studies have also noted complete disappearance of these abnormal collagen deposits after treatment with steroids for periods of up to almost four years.18 thus , the lesion may be reversible , at least temporarily , for prolonged periods . it may also be that the collagen deposits have different causes , in some instances being steroid - responsive . of note\n, in a recent report , collagen deposits completely revolved after resection of a localized colon cancer , suggesting a possible paraneoplastic phenomenon , expressed as this histopathologic marker in the intestinal mucosa.19\nin 1976 , similar deposits were detected in the colon in patients with a watery diarrhea syndrome.20,21 colorectal biopsies showed lamina propria sub - epithelial hyaline deposits similar to the deposits reported in the small intestine with collagenous sprue . although the endoscopic appearances were normal or near - normal , a microscopic mucosal inflammatory process was also present with increased lymphocytes and plasma cells .\nthe hyaline deposits stained positively with trichrome , characteristic of collagen and ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of collagen fibers .\nlater reports from large registries further detailed the clinical features.22,23 most patients were middle - aged or elderly females , however , collagenous colitis has also been detected in males and children.24 diarrhea was usually watery , nonbloody , and sometimes nocturnal , often with intermittent abdominal pain and weight loss .\noften , the diarrhea was present for weeks or months , resolving spontaneously for variable periods of time , then recurring with remissions and relapses over many years .\nthe pathogenesis of the diarrhea in collagenous colitis has been evaluated but still needs to be elucidated .\nsome functional studies of the small bowel and pancreas were normal.25 interestingly , however , some early case studies both adult and childhood celiac disease in collagenous colitis.2628 serological investigations failed to show a linkage with celiac disease29 and two retrospective studies of small bowel biopsies in collagenous colitis were contradictory.30,31 however , a long - term prospective small bowel biopsy study in collagenous colitis documented celiac disease in over 20% of subjects.32 recognition of celiac disease may be important from a therapeutic perspective because a gluten - free diet may resolve the diarrhea without need for other pharmacologic treatment .\nin addition , other autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis may be seen in collagenous colitis at similar frequencies to that recorded in celiac disease.32 finally , splenic hypofunction , often seen in celiac disease , has been recorded in collagenous colitis.33 some have classified collagenous colitis as a form of microscopic colitis . in part\n, this is due to a clinical paradigm that differentiates this entity from other inflammatory bowel disease disorders ( eg , ulcerative colitis , crohn s disease ) with macroscopically visible changes detected during endoscopic evaluation .\nanother type of microscopic colitis is lymphocytic colitis that serves to emphasize the predominant cell type in cases of watery diarrhea with macroscopically normal mucosa .\nsome believe that there may be an hypothetical relationship between lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis , however , the absence of collagen deposits ( in lymphocytic colitis ) may simply reflect their patchy and focal distribution in collagenous colitis .\ninterestingly , though , increased epithelial lymphocytosis ( without collagen deposits ) has been defined in colorectal mucosal biopsies from patients with celiac disease.34 bloody diarrhea is very unusual in collagenous colitis and usually suggests that another disorder is present and , recently , evolution of collagenous colitis into severe and extensive ulcerative colitis has been documented.35 complications of collagenous colitis may also occur , and these may be seen in adult celiac disease with concomitant collagenous colitis . surface epithelial sloughing is commonly seen in colonic biopsies leaving a  naked  sub - epithelial collagen deposit . in some ,\naltered mucosal permeability has been recorded and protein - losing enteropathy has been noted in the absence of small intestinal disease.8 submucosal \ndissection  has been described.36 colonic fracturing after endoscopic instrumentation , possibly related to air insufflation and barotraumas , or insertion of barium contrast agents , has been recorded.37 recently , a report entitled  cat scratch colon  emphasized the macroscopic changes in the colon in collagenous colitis.38 spontaneous peritonitis with colonic perforation has also been recorded.39 a rarity of malignant disease has been noted in collagenous colitis , such as colonic carcinoma.40 other neoplasms have also been recorded including lymphoproliferative disorders41 and carcinoids.42\nalthough lymphocytic gastritis was originally noted in patients with celiac disease or sprue - like intestinal disease,43 other chronic gastritis types may occur . in 1989 ,\na form of chronic gastritis was initially described characterized by gastric sub - epithelial collagen deposits with a background inflammatory process.44 the presence of collagen in these deposits was confirmed using ultrastructural methods and observed in both adults and children.45 later , this entity was noted in celiac disease.46 some recent studies have shown concomitant collagen deposits elsewhere in the intestinal mucosa , suggesting that , in some instances , collagenous disease may be a far more extensive inflammatory disease process.47\ndiagnosis of celiac disease is usually straightforward , but occasionally , it may prove to be difficult .\nonce established , however , the clinician should be alert to other luminal mucosal disorders , such as collagenous colitis , that may complicate the clinical course of celiac disease .\nconversely , collagenous colitis or other specific luminal mucosal disorders may be the presenting manifestation of underlying celiac disease .","abstract":" celiac disease is a gluten -

In 1988, a case was reported of a male with refractory bowel disease caused by active, fulminant and progressive infiltration of the small intestinal wall by eosinophilic granulocytes. The bowel perforation in this patient was the result of the extensive and diffuse involvement by eosinophils in the microvilli tips of all the epithelial cells. It was the first report of a case with a massive eosinophilic infiltration of the small intestine and the cause of extensive bowel perforation.\nAn interesting case was recorded by a 36 yr - old male patient with non specific bowel disease of long duration.11,12 the patient was admitted for acute intestinal obstruction after bowel perforation. Histological evaluation of the small intestine confirmed the presence of an infiltrate of round cells in the mucosa (Fig.5A) and in deeper tissues of the bowel wall.\nThe infiltrate was present as a band in the lamina propria (Fig.5B) that was accompanied by a lymphoid-like pattern of the epithelium. An immunoperoxidase study was performed to confirm the presence of eosinophils in the infiltrate and the result confirmed the presence of a band pattern distribution of the eosinophils in the lamina propria (Fig.5C). In addition, the infiltrate contained mature macrophages with eosinophilic-staining phagocytic vacuoles (Fig.5D) confirming the existence of a reactive process in the small bowel. A clinical and morphological approach to a case of eosinophilic colitis in a 35 yr - old female who was reported by a group of physicians in 1989, reported the presence of a mild inflammatory infiltrate in the deep layers of the mucosa and an extensive mucosal damage which was confirmed by the absence of goblet cells in the submucosal layer.

40 ) or a(1 - 42 )   with approximately picomolar or nanomolar affinity ( k \n d \n  = 1  10  m for a(1 - 42 ) ;   k \n d \n  = 57  5  10  m for a(1 - 40 ) ) .\nthe presence of added or in vivo buffers may lower the effective affinity to a considerable extent [ 1 , 3 ] .\nthe cu(ii ) is bound as type 2 , that is , distorted square planar arrangements of ligands with possibly one or two additional axial ligands .\nepr measurements indicate a 3n1o equatorial coordination pattern . at room temperature , two [ 3 , 57 ] or three   forms\nthe lower ph component is referred to as component i ( or ia and ib )   while the higher ph component is component ii , all with 3n1o coordination .\nit is likely that the three n ligands are due to a combination of the imidazole groups of his6 , his13 , his14 , a deprotonated amide n , and the n - terminus since these are the most common ligands for copper bound in proteins .\nindeed , there is direct evidence , obtained by esr experiments on a(1 - 16 ) in which the histidines were isotopically enriched with n , that all three his residues bind to cu(ii ) at physiological ph = 7.4 [ 1012 ] .\nthe origin of the o ligand is a subject of some debate , although tyr10 , glu3 , asp7 , and glu11 have been ruled out , as has water . on the basis of hyperfine sublevel correlation ( hyscore )\nspectroscopy applied to site - specific c and n labeled a(1 - 16 ) , the carbonyl of ala2 is implicated as the o ligand in the coordination mode at higher ph = 8.0 ( component ii ) , along with all three his residues .\nph ( ph = 8.79 ) , studies by both epr   and nmr   on labeled compounds seem to indicate that deprotonation and coordination of the amide n of ala2 occurs , together with the n - terminal nh2 and one or two his side chains .\nhureau and faller and coworkers [ 6 , 7 ] assigned this high ph structure as  component ii ,  but it is at odds with the structure deduced by others at physiological ph that does not involve the n - terminus and was designated component ii .\nthere is general but not universal agreement that the n - terminus is also part of the native a\/cu binding site , although the nature of its involvement is still unclear . in an earlier study ,\nkarr and coworkers found that copper binding to a was sensitive to changes in the n - terminus , including deletion , but , in a subsequent study , they note that removal or mutation of asp1 does not disrupt the equatorial coordination sphere .\nthey propose that the n - terminus participates via hydrogen bonding to an axial ligand .\nkowalik - jankowska et al . carried out potentiometric and spectroscopic measurements on both human and mouse a(1 - 16 ) and a(1 - 28 ) over a wide ph range , 2.510.5 , and noted a significant shift in the coordination pattern upon acetylation of the n - terminus in all cases . barnham and coworkers used multifrequency cw - epr spectroscopy applied to site - specific n - labeling at asp1 , his6 , his13 , and his14 of a(1 - 16 ) to deduce the presence at ph = 6 - 7 of two independent 3n1o cu coordination modes both of which incorporated the n - terminal nh2 group , an o atom , his6 , but only one of his13 ( component ia ) or his14 ( component ib ) . on the other hand , hong et al .\n, propose that the 3n1o coordination arises from an equilibrium between three structures at ph = 6.57.4 that all incorporate , beside an  o  atom , the n - terminal nh2 group , his6 , and either a deprotonated backbone amide residue or one of his13 or his14 , but not simultaneously his13 and his14 .\nboth low ph results are in qualitative agreement with the structure assigned to component i at ph = 6 by hureau and faller and coworkers who proved coordination of the nh2 and carbonyl groups of asp1 together with his6 and one of his13 and his14 . besides being highly ph dependent , indications are that copper coordination is probably size dependent as well .\nuniformly n - labelled a(1 - 40 ) at ph = 7.3 found that the asp1 signals were not shifted upon addition of cu and seem to indicate that the n - terminus is not involved in copper binding at all . on the basis of ab initio computations on model systems\n, we have previously proposed that the primary binding site of cu(ii ) to a is his13his14 which provide two of the three observed n ligands through n of the imidazole groups . by our procedures , we could not verify the presence or absence of the carbonyl o atom of ala2 as has been proposed experimentally . however , in the computations , the o of the intervening amide group ( o of his13 ) inevitably became coordinated to the cu(ii ) .\no  of the 3n1o coordination pattern and that the third  n  was probably that of his6 or asp1 .\npossibly because of the excessively high affinity constant calculated in that study , log10k \n aff = 19 , this suggestion has not been taken seriously by any of the experimental groups that have examined cu coordination to a. we have since reevaluated the binding by the procedures employed in the present work and found a substantially lower value , log10k \n aff = 6.3 ,   that is more in accordance with the accepted data for cu(ii ) binding to a .\nwe note that isothermal calorimetry experiments by hong et al . found that cu binding to his13his14 is most favored by the enthalpic contribution to the free energy change but that the enthalpic preference was overwhelmed by an unfavorable entropic term .\nless is known experimentally about the coordination of cu(i ) to a. we have previously [ 19 , 20 ] modeled the attachment of cu(i ) to the his13his14 region of a by computational methodology similar to that employed in the present work .\nthe computations suggest that cu(i ) is dicoordinated and bound to the two his sidechains via the proximal n atoms ( n ) in a linear fashion .\nhave demonstrated such binding experimentally by exafs and xanes data and results carried out on copper(i ) complexes of small hishis peptides , and fragments of a . such a structure\napparently , cu(i ) binds to a(1 - 16 ) with femtomolar affinity , much higher than does cu(ii ) .\nthe linear two - coordinate complexes were also able to add a third imidazole ligand in a t - shaped configuration in a dynamic process that interchanges all three his residues .\ninterestingly , the two - coordinate complexes were resistant to oxidation , but the three - coordinate complexes were redox active\n. however , the cu(i ) complexes with hishis containing fragments were able to produce h2o2 in the presence of o2 but without added reducing agents .\nthe amount of h2o2 produced was independent of the presence of tyr10 ( a potential source of electrons ) or other residues such as asp1 or his6 which are potential binding sites for the copper .  \naqueous cu has a one - electron reduction potential e = 0.17  v versus the standard hydrogen electrode ( she ) .\nan early report that monomeric cu(ii)\/a(1 - 42 ) had an exceptionally high reduction potential e  0.7  v versus she   has been discounted as due to oligomer formation .\n 0.30  v0.34  v [ 28 , 29 ] which represents a modest elevation of the oxidizing power of the cu(ii ) upon complexation to a. brzyska et al . , find a concentration- and buffer - dependent reduction of the reduction potential upon addition of cu(ii ) to monomeric a(1 - 40 ) , although , in the absence of buffer , their value is similar to the others . as noted above , there is uncertainty as to the actual nature of the oxidized and reduced species involved .\nreport a wide difference between the reduction potential and oxidation potential of copper bound to a(1 - 28 ) , 0.33  v and 0.63  v , respectively .\nthis is taken as an indication of different geometries at the cu(ii ) and cu(i ) binding sites .  \nwe have undertaken the present study in order to examine the role of asp1 in the coordination of cu(ii ) as well as cu(i ) in a. we employ a higher level of theoretical treatment than was previously applied in order to estimate the binding affinities of complexes containing all combinations of asp1 , modeled by the n - methyl amide derivative , 1 ( figure 2 ) , his6 , modeled by imidazole ( i m ) , an amide carbonyl , modeled by n - methylacetamide ( nma ) , and his13his14 , modeled as previously [ 17 , 20 ] by n--dihydrourocanylhistamine , 5 ( figure 3 ) . simultaneous involvement of both asp1 and ala2 were modeled by the n - methyl amide derivative of asp1ala2 , 3 ( figure 1 ) .\nreduction potentials for various cu(ii)\/cu(i ) couples were also derived and compared with experimental values in order to elucidate the nature of the species involved .\nall calculations were carried out with gaussian 03 and 09 [ 31 , 32 ] using the hybrid density functional method , b3lyp , and second - order moller - plesset perturbation theory .\ngaseous - phase geometry optimization , harmonic frequency calculation , and thermochemical parameters were determined at the b3lyp\/6 - 31  +  g(d ) basis set , which is henceforth referred to as the small basis set ( sb ) .\nthe frequency calculation confirmed that the optimized structures were at local minima on the potential energy hypersurface .\nthe zero point energies were scaled by 0.9806 . however , this was not done for the thermal correction of enthalpy or entropies . in the case of the zwitterionic asp1 , 1 ( figure 1 ) and asp1ala2 , 3 ( figure 2 ) , it was necessary to optimize the structure and carry out frequency analysis in the presence of the solvent reaction field ( scrf = iefpcm ) , where iefpcm is the integral equation following polarizable continuum model [ 35 , 36 ] with the default parameters for water .\nchemical intuition was used to seek the most stable structures , and no attempt was made to do a comprehensive search of conformational space . instead\n, account was taken of conformational flexibility by the addition of an approximate entropy of mixing term , rln(n ) , where n is an estimate of the number of conformers derived by simple rotamer counting .\nvalues of n are listed in table s2 in supplementary materials available online at doi : 10.4061\/2011\/539762 .\nentropies were also converted to a state of 1  m by addition of the term for volume change , r  ln(1\/24.46 ) , where 24.46 litres is the volume of 1  mol of ideal gas at 298  k. for more accurate enthalpies and to compensate for the lack of long - range dispersion energy in b3lyp , single - point energies were calculated at an approximation for the mp2\/lb level ,  \n ( 1)e(mp2\/lb)e(mp2\/sb)+e(b3lyp \/ lb)e(b3lyp \/ sb ) , \n where lb is the large basis set , 6 - 311+(2df,2p ) .  \ndetails of all computed quantities and structural information , are provided in tables s1 and s2 , respectively .\nmolden 4.0 was used as a visualization tool . in order to calculate the free energy change in water , g \n ( aq ) , the change in the free energy of solvation , g \n solv ,\nwas added to the free energy change in the gaseous phase , g \n ( g ) , corrected for a standard state of 1  m. g \n solv was determined using iefpcm [ 35 , 36 ] as implemented in g03 , and the b3lyp \/ sb density . in our experience ,\ncharged species are undersolvated by the iefpcm with standard scaling of the united atom hartree - fock ( uahf ) radii , so selective scaling was applied as follows : the radii of the metal ion and all atoms directly attached to it were scaled by a factor of 1.1 ; all other atoms were scaled by the default value , 1.2 .\nexperimental rather than calculated relative free energies of solvation were applied where available in order to reduce errors further . for the proton , g \n\nthe experimental value of g \n solv was adopted for h2o , 16.2  kj  mol , where the value reflects the fact that water is 55.6  m. for all other species , free energies of solvation were taken as calculated by the procedure described above .\ncu(ii)\/cu(i )  couple , relative to the standard hydrogen electrode ( she ) , e(cu(ii)\/cu(i )  ) , is defined by  \n ( 2)e(cu(ii)\/cu(i))=(g(aq)cug(aq)she)\/f , \n where f is the faraday constant , f = 96.485  kj  mol  v , g \n ( aq ) \n  is the free energy change for the standard hydrogen cell half reaction , ( 1\/2)h2(g ) + e  h \n ( aq ) , ( g \n ( aq ) \n  = 418  kj  mol , ignoring the electron ) , and g \n ( aq ) \n  is the calculated free energy change for reaction ( 3 ) , again ignoring the electron \n ( 3)cu(ii)(aq)+  ecu(i)(aq)+al . \n in ( 3 ) , \ncu(ii )  and  cu(i )  represent species containing oxidized and reduced copper , respectively .\nthe symbol al recognizes the fact that a number of ligands may be shed in the reduction process and that the associated entropy change may be an important component of the free energy change .\nthe actual potential , e , of the half reaction under ambient conditions is related to the standard potential , e , through the nernst equation , \n ( 4)e = e(rtf)lnq , \n where q is the reaction quotient specifying concentrations of oxidized and reduced components and other species associated with the chemical change . in the special case that n protons are consumed in solution buffered at ph = 7 under otherwise standard conditions\n, the reaction quotient reduces to q = 10 , and the symbol , e , denotes the potential at ph 7 ( e = e  ( rt \/ f)lnq = e  0.41nv ) .   for most of the energy differences calculated in the following sections , errors inherent in the calculation of absolute values\ncould be expected to cancel yielding reliable relative energies . however , this is less likely to be the case for the calculation of aqueous free energy changes for reactions such as ( 3 ) .\nsince a transition element is involved and the number of electrons changes , the enthalpy change will be less accurately described at this theoretical level than expected for lighter elements .\nan extreme case is illustrated by the difference between the calculated ( at the b3lyp \/ lb level ) and experimental second ionization potential of atomic copper ( ie2 ( calc ) = 2008  kj  mol ; ie2 ( exp ) = 1958  kj  mol ) .\nthe discrepancy is most likely due to the unequal treatment of electron correlation ( an enthalpic term ) . as in a previous publication\n, we assume that the error in the ionization potential of cu will be present in the reduction potentials , e(cu(ii)(aq)\/cu(i)(aq ) ) , irrespective of the metal environment since they all involve the change in copper oxidation state from + 2 to + 1 . without correcting for the error in the enthalpy change ,\nthe calculated value for the reduction of aqueous cupric ion is e(cu(h2o)5 \n \/cu(h2o)3 \n ) = 0.42  v versus she , compared to the experimental value , e(cu(aq)\/cu(aq ) ) = 0.17  v .\nan empirical correction of + 57  kj  mol brings the calculated and experimental numbers into agreement .\nthus for addition of an electron to any cu species , the correction to the calculated h is taken as + 57  kj  mol .   with the procedures described above\n, we expect that aqueous free energy changes , g \n ( aq ) , will be accurate to 15  kj  mol for all of the reactions considered .\nthe b3lyp \/ sb - optimized structures and all calculated energies and thermochemical properties are provided in tables s1 and s2 and shown in figures 13 .\nchemical transformations and aqueous free energy changes are given in the following in the form of numbered equations which are repeated in table 1 along with a complete breakdown of the components at the mp2\/lb level .\nthe n - terminal asp1 of a is modeled by 1 ( figure 1 ) , where the c - terminus is derivatized by nhch3 .\nthe most stable form of the aqueous cupric ion is the pentaaqua structure , cu(h2o)5 \n .\nreaction with 1 yielded numerous aquated structures 2 with different patterns of chelation : \n ( 5a)1+cu(h2o)52+2a(h2o)2 + 3h2o+h+;g(5a)=18.0  kj  mol1 , \n ( 5b)1+cu(h2o)52+  2b(h2o)2 + 3h2o+h+;g(5b)=+14.3  kj  mol1 , \n ( 5c)1+cu(h2o)52+2c(h2o)2 + 3h2o+h+ ;  g(5c)=+29.1  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 5a ) , g \n ( 5b ) , and g \n ( 5c ) , have been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nstructures of 2a(h2o)2 , 2b(h2o)2 , and 2c(h2o)2 are shown in figure 1 . it should be noted from table 1 that the release of multiple water molecules in processes such as ( 5a)(5c ) endows a large entropic component favoring complex formation . in addition , release of a proton into a solution buffered to ph = 7 provides an additional 40  kj  mol ( = rt  ln(10 ) ) as a driving force for the forward direction .\nof the three 1  :  1 complexes , only the most stable , 2a(h2o)2 , is formed exergonically at physiological ph . this structure has a square pyramidal configuration with three - point coordination of the asp residue to the cupric ion .\nthe amino and carboxylate groups form adjacent corners of the square , and the carbonyl of the amide occupies the axial position .\nstructure 2b(h2o)2 , which is lacking the axial carbonyl oxygen coordination , is less stable than 2a(h2o)2 by 32  kj  mol .\no bond strength of the coordinated carbonyl oxygen of asp1 is about 50  kj  mol ( table 1 ) .\nthe most stable structure with a deprotonated amide n coordinated to the cu(ii ) is 2c(h2o)2 , which is 47  kj  mol less stable than 2a(h2o)2 .\nthe amide n and the n - terminal nh2 groups occupy adjacent corners of the square pyramidal base with two waters in the other two corners .\nthe neutral carboxylic acid group of 2c is attached to the axial position with a long bond ( 2.43   , compared to the average cu - oh2 distance , 2.08   ) .   the amide - deprotonated structure , 2c(h2o)2 , is not predicted to be stable in water .\nhowever , such a structure permits additional chelation by the carbonyl of the same residue , ala2 in the present model system .\nthus , 3 ( i.e. , asp1ala2 ) ( figure 2 ) may provide three ligands for cu(aq ) if the amide group is deprotonated .\nthe bicyclic structure , 4(h2o ) ( figure 2 ) , is the most stable structure that has coordination by the n - terminal nh2 of asp1 and the deprotonated amide n and carbonyl o of ala2 to the cu .\nall three groups occupy sites in the equatorial coordination plane , the last site being occupied by a water molecule .\na second water h bonds to the first and the carboxylic acid group rather than to the copper .\nthe carboxylate group of asp1 is protonated and interacting with the copper only through h - bonding to the bound water .\nequation ( 6 ) examines the stability of 4(h2o ) relative to the dissociated species : \n ( 6)3+cu(h2o)54(h2o)+4h2o+h+;g(6)=10.2  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 6 ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nthus , compared to ( 5c ) , coordination by the o of ala2 provides an additional 19  kj  mol of stabilization but is not enough to render the complex stable in water at physiological ph .\nthe predicted pk \n a of the carboxylate proton of 4(h2o ) is 10 , indicating that the deprotonated form of 4(h2o ) would be stable at ph = 9 .\ninteraction of cu(aq ) with one and two his is represented by : \n ( 7a)im+cu(h2o)52+cu(im)(h2o)42++h2o;g(7a)=0.5  kj  mol1 , \n ( 7b)2im+cu(h2o)52+cu(im)2(h2o)32++2h2o;g(7b)=10.9  kj  mol1 . \n\nthe structures of the two im \/ cu(ii ) complexes are shown in figure 1 .\ndisplacement of a water ligand by i m is predicted to be isoergonic , g \n ( 7b ) = 0.5  kj  mol .\nthis result derives from the near cancellation of a highly exergonic change in the gaseous phase by a correspondingly large loss of free energy of solvation ( the g \n ( g ) and g \n solv terms in table 1 ) .\nit is in disagreement with results derived from early ph measurements which found log10 \n  \n 1 = 3.76 or g \n 1 = 21  kj  mol .\naddition of the second i m was found experimentally to have log10 \n  \n 2 = 3.39 or g \n 1 = 19  kj  mol .\nthe displacement of a second water is calculated to be more favored , by 10  kj  mol .\nthe computed results suggest that a monoadduct will disproportionate to form the bisadduct and aqueous cu(ii ) .\nthe preferred orientation of the imidazole rings in cu(im)2(h2o)3 is perpendicular to the basal square plane . in the bis(im ) complex , both cis- and trans - diastereomers are stable and are nearly isoergonic . in the cis - structure ,\nthe single i m in cu(im )  ( h2o)4 \n  is intended to represent his6 or one of his13 or his14 . the second i m of cu(im)2(h2o)3 \n  may be one of his13 or his14 , or a his6 from a second a. thus , the 1  :  1 interaction of cu(aq ) with i m is less favorable than with asp1 by 18  kj  mol and the 1  :  2 interaction is comparable .   the most stable structures , 2a(im)(h2o ) and 2a(im)2 , for the 1  :  1  :  1 and 1  :  1  :  2 complexes , respectively , between cu(aq ) , asp1 , and i m are shown in figure 1 . structure 2a(im)(h2o ) is related to 2a(h2o)2 by the substitution of the water that is anti to the carboxylate group by i m .\nsubstitution in 2a(h2o)2 of the water anti to the amino group yielding 2b(im)(h2o ) results in loss of the axial ligand and distortion of the basal plane .\nstructure 2a(im)(h2o ) is more stable than 2b(im)(h2o ) by 38  kj  mol ( from data in table s2 ) .  \nsubstitution of both waters of 2a(h2o)2 by i m yields 2a(im)2 . a second structure , 2b(im)2 , in which the i m residues are opposite the nh2 and amide carbonyl groups , and the carboxylate group occupies the axial position , is also stable . in 2b(im)2\n, the carboxylate group is coordinated through one of the oxygen atoms but perpendicular to the co2 plane .\nstructure 2a(im)2 is more stable than 2b(im)2 ( figure 1 ) by 11  kj  mol .\nequations ( 8a ) and ( 8b ) explore the possible reactions that may yield the 1  :  1  :  1 cu(aq ) , asp1 , and i m adduct , 2a(im)(h2o):(8a)2a(h2o)2+im2a(im)(h2o)+h2o;g(8a)=24.1  kj  mol1 , \n ( 8b)1+cu(im)(h2o)42+2a(im)(h2o)+3h2o+h+;g(8b)=41.6  kj  mol1,where g \n ( 8b ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nthus , 2a(im)(h2o ) is stable with respect to dissociation either by releasing an imidazole ligand or the n - terminal asp . in the context to a ,\nthese results imply that asp1 1 and any of the his residues may form a stable complex with cu(ii ) in water at physiological ph .  \nthe possible formation of the 1  :  1  :  2 complex , 2a(im)2 , is explored in reactions ( 9a ) and ( 9b ) : \n ( 9a)2a(im)(h2o)+im2a(im)2+h2o;g(9a)=11.0  kj  mol1 , \n ( 9b)1+cu(im)2(h2o)32+2a(im)2 + 3h2o+  h+;g(9b)=42.2  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 9b ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nthus , as with 2a(im)(h2o ) , the 1  :  1  :  2 complex , 2a(im)2 , is also stable toward dissociation , and , in the context to a , these results imply that asp1 , his6 , and either of his13 or his14 may form stable complexes in water at physiological ph .   by ( 6 ) , it was apparent that deprotonation of the amide n ( of ala2 ) required coordination of the o of ala2 in order to afford a complex , 4(h2o ) , that could be formed at ph = 9 but was not stable at ph = 7 . equations ( 10a ) and ( 10b )\nexamine the possibility that the water of 4(h2o ) may be displaced by i m :  \n ( 10a)4(h2o)+im4(im)+h2o;g(10a)=20.5  kj  mol1 , \n ( 10b)3+cu(h2o)52++im4(im)+5h2o+h+;g(10b)=10.3  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 10b ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nthus , the additional stabilization afforded by replacing water by i m ( 10a ) , is sufficient to render the product , 4(im ) ( figure 2 ) , stable in water at physiological ph ( 10b ) , but would have only marginal stability at lower ph , g \n ( 10b ) = 4  kj  mol at ph = 6 .\nthe carboxylate group of asp1 is h - bonded to the nh2 group and not interacting with the copper .\ndeprotonation of 4(im ) affords 4(im)(co2 \n ) ( figure 2 ) with pk \n a = 11 .\n4(im)(co2 \n ) is pentacoordinated with the carboxylate group occupying the fifth site . in the context of a , ( 10a ) and\n( 10b ) imply that a 3n1o complex incorporating the n - terminal nh2 group , the carbonyl o , and the deprotonated amide n of ala2 , and one of his6 , his13 or h14 , should be observed at physiological ph :  \n ( 11)4(im)+im4(im)2;g(11)=6.9  kj  mol1 . \n by ( 11 )\n, coordination of a second i m to the vacant axial coordination site of 4(im ) to yield 4(im)2 ( figure 2 ) is unfavorable by 7  kj  mol .\nsuch a structure may be an intermediate for the interchange of the his residues of a.   but is a deprotonated amide structure like 4(im ) stable compared to a form like 2a(im)2 in which the amide is protonated and ala2 is not involved ?\nequation ( 12 ) compares the stability of the most stable copper - coordinated structure that uses both asp1 and ala2 , 4(im ) , with one that does not involve ala2 , namely , 2a(im)2 : \n ( 12)4(im)+im+12a(im)2 + 3;g(12)=42.8  kj  mol1 . \n\nthe relatively large exergonicity of ( 12 ) , g \n ( 12 ) = 43  kj  mol , strongly suggests that ala2 is not involved in the bonding in the n - terminal copper - bound species .\nthe principal reason , from table 1 , is enthalpic ( h \n ( 12 ) = 84  kj  mol and is a consequence of the greater acidity of the carboxylate group than of the amide group .\nthus , 2a(im)2 is the closest model for component i of a , but raising the ph , at least in the physiological range , does not lead to component ii as proposed by faller and hureau and coworkers [ 6 , 7 ] . in the following section\n, we propose another structure for component ii and discuss the nature of the ph dependence .\nwe explore below the special case of his13his14 where the i m groups of the two his residues are tethered by an intervening amide link .\nthe tethering has an important consequence . as with 3 , this configuration permits three - point chelation to the copper , a favorable contribution to the free energy of binding , but without the penalty of amide deprotonation .  \nthe his13his14 sequence of a is modeled by 5 ( figure 3 ) , in which only the two side chains and the intervening amide link are preserved .\nthe interaction between 5 and cu(aq ) yielding 6(h2o)2 was recently studied experimentally and reexamined theoretically by the procedures employed in the present paper .\nthe calculated association constant , log10k \n ( 12 ) for ( 13 ) , was in good agreement with the experimental value , log10 \n k \n as = 5.6 : \n ( 13)5+cu(h2o)52+  6(h2o)2 + 3h2o;g(13)=36.0  kj  mol1 ;  log10k(13)=6.3 . \n\nstructure 6(h2o)2 , which models the mode of attachment of cu(ii ) to his13his14 , has the two i m groups in the trans - positions of a distorted square plane .\nthe backbone amide carbonyl oxygen and a water molecule occupy the other two opposing sites .\nthe trans - orientation of the two i m groups is the favored mode of attachment as seen in trans - cu(im)2(h2o)3 ( figure 1 ) .\nit has been argued that the copper does not attach to a hishis sequence through the n atoms in a trans - arrangement as in 6(h2o)2 , but rather through the n atoms in a cis - arrangement .\nthe latter is the configuration seen in the crystal structure of bis(cyclo - l - histidyl - l - histidyl)copper(ii ) , the cyclic anhydride of histidine . in this compound\n, cu chelates to the n atom of the imidazole rings in a cis - arrangement . in the present system , the most stable structure\nin which cu(ii ) is attached to 5 with the cis coordination pattern , is 6(h2o)3 ( tables s1 and s2 ) ) .\nstructure 6(h2o)3 is predicted to be less stable relative to 6(h2o)2 + h2o by 36  kj  mol .\nthe constraint imposed by the framework of the cyclic anhydride of histidine does not permit bridging of the copper ion through one or both n atoms of the i m groups . in 5 , or in monomeric a , there are no such constraints .\nwe also found structures , 6(h2o)2 and 6(h2o)2 ( tables s1 and s2 ) ) , in which coordination is through one n and one n nitrogen of 5 .\nthese also have the cis orientation and are even less stable , 46 and 51  kj  mol ( data in table s2 ) .\nwe do not consider these structures to be relevant to the chemistry of cu \/ a in alzheimer 's disease and do not discuss them further .  \nspecies 6(h2o)2 may add an additional i m residue yielding , 6(im)(h2o ) . the results are presented in :  \n ( 14)6(h2o)2+im6(im)(h2o)+h2o  ; g(14)=12.5  kj  mol1 . \n\nthe remaining water is in an axial orientation with a long cu - o separation , 2.40   .\nexchange of the water by an o of an amide carbonyl group ( of nma = n - methylacetamide ) yields 7 ( figure 3 ) . in 7 ,\nthe two carbonyl groups occupy equivalent positions in the equatorial plane of a trigonal bipyramidal configuration about the cu(ii ) ion .\nattempts to optimize square planar structures with the o of his13 or nma in an axial position converged to similar trigonal bipyramidal structures .\nthe reaction is described in : \n ( 15)6(im)(h2o)+nma7+h2o;g(15)=20.5  kj  mol1 ;  log10k(15)=3.6 . \n\nreaction ( 15 ) is moderately exergonic in water , indicating that the cu(ii ) environment could consist of the three his residues and an additional carbonyl group . in the context of cu \/ a , the experimental results of barnham and coworkers , and the theoretical modeling of sodupe and coworkers , on cu(ii)\/a(1 - 16 ) , the obvious candidate for the additional carbonyl o is ala2 .\nwe note however that displacement of water by nma is strongly endothermic in the gaseous phase , h \n ( g ) = 68  kj  mol ( table 1 ) .\nthis is a consequence of the steric crowding about the cu(ii ) site that forces the unusual trigonal bipyramidal geometry .\nthe exergonicity of reaction ( 15 ) in water ensues from an even larger favorable change in the free energy of solvation , g \n ( aq ) = 84  kj  mol ( table 1 ) .\nsolvation was also found to favor the coordination of the o of ala2 in the work of sodupe and coworkers .\nthe most stable structures corresponding to the 1  :  1  :  1 complex between cu(aq ) , asp1 , and his13his14 ( 5 ) , namely , 8a and 8b , are shown in figure 2 . the more stable of the two , 8a , has a square pyramidal coordination sphere about the copper , with bidentate coordination of the nh2 and co2 \n  groups of the asp in the basal square .\none of the i m groups ( formally of his13 ) and the backbone amide carbonyl group of 5 form the other two corners .\nthe other i m group ( formally of his14 ) has moved into the apical site . the second structure , 8b , which is less stable by 18  kj  mol , has the same square pyramidal 3n1o basal configuration as 8a , but the apical i m group has released .\npossible routes for the formation of the more stable isomer 8a are examined in : \n ( 16a)1 + 6(h2o)28a+2h2o+h+;g(16a)=+2.8  kj  mol1 , \n ( 16b)2a(h2o)2 + 5  8a+2h2o;g(16b)=15.2  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 16a ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 . the negative free energy change of ( 16b ) ,\ng \n ( 16b ) = 15 kj mol , indicates that if the cupric ion was already attached to 2a(h2o)2 , that is , the n - terminus , it can also associate with 5 , that is , his13his14 .\nhowever , the small positive value , g \n ( 16a ) = + 3  kj  mol , indicates that 8a would be partially dissociated , releasing the n - terminal asp .\nequation ( 17a ) addresses the question of whether the n - terminus can be coordinated if there are already three his residues coordinated to the copper ion .\nsuch a structure , 9 , is shown in figure 3 : \n ( 17a)1 + 6(im)(h2o)9+h2o+h+;g(17a)=+22.0  kj  mol1 , \n ( 17b)98a+im;g(17b)=6.7  kj  mol1 , \n ( 17c)9+h2o+h+5 + 2a(im)(h2o);g(17c)=24.4  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 17a ) and g \n ( 17c ) have been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nthe moderately high value , g \n ( 17a ) = 22  kj  mol , indicates that simultaneous attachment of all four potential ligands to cu(ii ) , the n - terminal asp and the three histidines , is not likely at physiological ph .\nequations ( 17b ) and ( 17c ) indicate that such an arrangement would be unstable with respect to loss of one histidine but not two .   in the context of a ,\nthe overall picture that emerges from the above considerations is that the n - terminus and all three his residues may not be simultaneously associated with the cupric ion .\nhowever , such a structure could be a transitional form connecting more stable structures in which the cu(aq ) is attached to his6 , his13 , and his14 ( 6(im)(h2o ) or 7 ) ( figure 3 ) or to the n - terminus and two of the three his residues , his6 and his13 , or his6 and his14 ( both modeled by 2a(im)2 ) ( figure 1 ) but not his13 and his14 ( 8a is unstable by ( 16a ) ) ( figure 3 ) .\nthus , structure 2a(im)2 , with 3n1o equatorial coordination to cu(ii ) , serves as a model for components ia and ib . in each case\nstructure 7 is preferred because it is more stable , but it formally has a 3n2o coordination pattern in a trigonal bipyramid . the computed results for cu(ii ) species agree in most respects with experimental expectations , except possibly for the nature of the o ligand , which would be the carbonyl o atom of his13 if 6(im)(h2o ) proves to be the better model for component ii .\nhowever , favoring 7 in this respect also is the experimental   and other computational   evidence that the  o  should be the o atom of ala2 provided the approximately equivalent equatorial o atoms of the trigonal bipyramidal geometry would manifest as 3n1o coordination in epr experiments .\nattempts on our part to completely displace the o of his13 in cu(ii ) complexes by any other ligand always failed .  \nif component i is modeled by 2a(im)2 and component ii is modeled by 7 , what then is the nature of the ph dependence that shifts the equilibrium from one to the other in the narrow physiological ph range ?\nwe suggest that , since the pk \n a of his residues is in this range , one or more of the his residues would be protonated .\nthe presence of the cu ion sets up a delicate balance : in component i , either his13 or his14 is protonated , permitting the other to bind to the copper together with his6 and asp1 ( but not ala2 ) ; at a slightly higher ph , the remaining his is deprotonated and all three can bind to the copper , displacing asp1 but leaving the nearby o of ala2 attached .\nthe most stable form of the aqueous cuprous ion at the present theoretical level is the t - shaped triaqua structure , cu(h2o)3 \n  ( figure 4 ) , reaction with asp1 1 yielded several aquated structures with different patterns of chelation .\nthe most stable of these is the 1  :  1 cu(i )  :  asp1 complex , 2(h2o ) ( figure 4 , see the following equation ) : \n ( 18)1+cu(h2o)3+  2i(h2o)+2h2o+h+;g(18)=+5.3  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 18 ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nwe denote structures containing the cuprous ion by the superscript i on the structure number of the cu(ii ) equivalent . as with cu(h2o)5 \n  and cu(h2o)3 \n ,\nthe cuprous form of a complex will generally have fewer ligands than the equivalent cupric form .\nsome or all of the attached h2o will be lost upon reduction of the copper . if there is no attached water , then one or more of the coordinated ligands will be released upon reduction .\nthe structures of all complexes containing cu(i ) are shown in figure 4 . the small endergonic free energy change for reaction ( 18 ) in water , g \n ( 18 ) = 5  kj  mol at ph = 7 , suggests that there is a small amount of 1  :  1 complex formed between cu(aq ) and asp1 under physiological conditions .\nwe examine whether complexation of asp1 is feasible if the cuprous ion is already attached to one or more imidazoles .\nthe reactions for the 1  :  1 complex between cu(aq ) and i m , cu(im)(h2o ) , is given in : \n ( 19)im+cu(h2o)3+cu(im)(h2o)++2h2o;g(19)=16.3  kj  mol1 . \n\nthus , cu(im)(h2o ) is stable in water and the free energy of complexation is higher than for the equivalent cu(ii ) complex ( 7a ) .\nthe following reactions explore the addition of a second imidazole group to cu(im)(h2o ) , either as free i m or as his13 or his14 of 5 , yielding products cu(i \n m)2 \n  ( 20a ) , cu(im)(h13h14 ) ( 20b ) , and cu(im)(h14h13 ) ( 20c ) , respectively:(20a)im+cu(im)(h2o)+cu(im)2++h2o;g(20a)=27.4  kj  mol1 , \n ( 20b)5+cu(im)(h2o)+cu(im)(h13h14)++h2o;g(20b)=43.4  kj  mol1 , \n ( 20c)5+cu(im)(h2o)+cu(im)(h14h13)++h2o;g(20c)=31.1  kj  mol1.thus , addition of his14 of 5 is approximately equivalent energetically to the addition of a free i m group and both are more exergonic than addition of a single i m ( 19 )\n. addition of his13 ( 20b ) is more exergonic still due to a higher free energy of solvation ( table 1 ) which ensues as a consequence of the higher dipole moment of cu(im)(h13h14 ) ,  = 15.4  d compared to  = 13.2  d for cu(im)(h14h13 ) .\nboth 1  :  1  :  1 and 1  :  1  :  2 complexes between cu(i ) , asp1 1 , and i m , namely , 2(i \n m ) and 2(im)2 ( figure 4 ) , are stable in the gaseous phase .\nformation of the 1  :  1  :  1 complex , 2(im ) ( figure 4 ) , is essentially isoergonic at ph = 7 if one i m is already attached to cu(i ) : \n ( 21)1+cu(im)(h2o)+2i(im)+h2o+h+;g(21)=3.0  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 21 ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 .\naddition of a second i m to form the 1  :  1  :  2 complex , 2(im)2 ( figure 4 ) , is endergonic , g \n ( 22 ) = 23  kj  mol : \n ( 22)2i(im)+im2i(im)2;g(22)=22.7  kj  mol1 . \n\nbecause of the high affinity of cu(i ) for two imidazoles , addition of asp1 1 to the bis(imidazole)cu(i ) complex will not occur : \n ( 23)1+cu(im)2+2i(im)2+h+;g(23)=47.2  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 23 ) has been adjusted to ph = 7 . on the basis of this result , we have not attempted to add asp1 to cu(im)(h13h14 ) or cu(im)(h14h12 ) .  \ncu(i ) binds to the hishis region 5 yielding the 1  :  1 complex , 6 ( figure 4 ) , with high affinity , \n ( 24)5+cu(h2o)3+6i+3h2o;g(24)=72.8  kj  mol1 ;  log10k(24)=12.7 . \n\ncoordination of additional waters to 6 is endergonic , for example , g  15  kj  mol for the addition of one water ( data not shown ) .\nthe calculated affinity constant , log10 \n k \n ( 23 ) = 12.7 , is in very good agreement with that found for the cu(i)\/a(1 - 16 ) complex , log10 \n k \n aff  14 .\nthe value is substantially higher than for the addition of two free imidazoles to cu(aq ) ( 20a ) , or a free i m and one of the two imidazoles of 5 ( ( 20b ) and ( 20c ) ) , thus highlighting the importance of chelation .\nit is also higher than for the addition of cu(aq ) to hishis ( 13 ) .\nthe calculations clearly confirm   that cu(i ) will bind more strongly than cu(ii ) to a and that the preferred site of binding of cu(i ) is his13his14 .\nthe linear geometry and a cu - n distance of 1.877   in cu(i)\/a(1 - 40 ) was deduced from fitted exafs data by shearer and szalai .\nour calculated value for 6 , 1.894   , is in good agreement .  \naddition of asp1 1 to the linear cu(i)\/hishis complex , 6 , in the gaseous phase yields two stable structures , 8a \n  and 8b \n  ( figure 4 ) , of equal energy in water .\nhowever , the formation of either by addition of asp1 1 to 6 in water is highly endergonic ( ( 25a ) and ( 25b ) ) due to the high stability of 6 : \n ( 25a)1 + 6i8ai  + h+ ;  g(25a)=64.6  kj  mol1 , \n ( 25b)1 + 6i8bi  + h+ ;  g(25b)=63.4  kj  mol1 , \n where g \n ( 25a ) and g \n ( 25b ) have been adjusted to ph = 7 .\nequations ( 16a ) , ( 16b ) , and ( 17a ) indicate that the n - terminus will be weakly associated with cu(ii ) complexes of two of the his residues .\nhowever , upon reduction of the copper to cu(i ) , the n - terminus will be released leaving only the linear cu(i)\/hishis structure .\nequation ( 15 ) indicates that an amide carbonyl will be weakly associated with cu(ii ) complexes of all three his residues .\nequation ( 26 ) examines whether the carbonyl would remain attached to the reduced copper species , 6 : \n ( 26)nma+6i7i;g(26)=25.0  kj  mol1 . \n\nthe complex with nma ( n - methylacetamide ) , 7 ( figure 3 ) , is strongly bound in the gaseous phase , h \n ( ( 26),g ) = 59  kj  mol , but is formed endergonically in water due to a combination of loss of solvation free energy and an unfavorable entropic term ( table 1 ) .\naddition of i m to 6 to yield 6(im ) ( figure 4 ) is slightly endergonic , \n ( 27)im+6i6i(im);g(27)=10.1  kj  mol1 ;  log10k(27)=1.8 . \n as with nma , the addition reaction is endergonic principally by virtue of loss of free energy of solvation , but also in part due to the unfavorable change in entropy ( table 1 ) . in the context of\na reduced copper \/ a complex , there is ample experimental evidence that cu(i ) is bound to his13his14 precisely as depicted in 6 , in a linear fashion through the n of both i m groups ( figure 4 ) [ 21 , 22 , 46 ] .\nthe i m ( his6 ) is tethered to the cu(i ) binding region at his13his14 , and the loss of entropy may be less , reducing the endergonicity of ( 27 ) .\ncomputed reduction potentials for various combinations of cu(ii)\/a and cu(i)\/a coordination patterns , when compared with the experimental value for cu \/ a , e  0.30  v0.34  v , [ 28 , 29 , 47 ] may serve to distinguish among the different possibilities that have been suggested in the literature and discussed in the introduction . since all experimental indications suggest that a and cu \/ a are highly fluxional species , the most stable structures should be most populated .\nwe assume that electrochemical reduction is an equilibrium process . logically then , reduction of the ( predicted ) most stable cu(ii ) species , yielding the most stable cu(i ) species , should yield the most representative value of e or e. as a second point of reference , the experimental value for the reduction of aqueous cupric ion is e(cu(aq)\/cu(aq ) ) = 0.17  v .\nequation ( 28 ) describes the reduction process if the copper was attached only to the n - terminal asp1 : \n ( 28)2a(h2o)2+e2ai(h2o)+h2o;e(2a(h2o)2\/2ai(h2o))=0.07  v. \n the calculated standard reduction potential e(2a(h2o)2\/2a \n ( h2o ) ) = 0.07  v , is lower than the value for aqueous copper .\ntherefore , cu(ii ) can not be attached only to the n - terminus since the lower e is incompatible with the experimental observation that the reduction potential is elevated .\na lower value is expected since a negatively charged group is attached to the cu(ii ) , thereby lowering the net charge of the oxidized species .\nequation ( 29 ) describes reduction of copper attached in a 1  :  1 ratio to asp1 and i m the cu(ii ) species , 2a(im)(h2o ) , was found to be stable in water ( ( 8a ) and ( 8b ) ) , but the cu(i ) species , 2(i \n m ) , had only transient stability ( 21 ) : \n ( 29)2a(im)(h2o)+e2i(im)+h2o;e(2a(im)(h2o)\/2i(im))=0.07  v. \n the result , e(2a(im)(h2o)\/2(i \n m ) ) ) = 0.07  v , indicates that the presence of the i m moiety has little effect on the predicted reduction potential .   with respect to the possibility that cu(ii ) may be coordinated to asp1 and two of the i m moieties , the cu(ii ) species , 2a(im)2 ,\nwas found to be stable at ph = 7 ( ( 9a ) and ( 9b ) ) .\nstructure 2a(im)2 corresponds to component i , the low ph species , in which cu(ii ) is attached to his6 and either his13 or his14 as well as the n - terminus .\nthe corresponding reduced species , 2(im)2 was found to release the asp ( 23 ) .\nequations ( 30a ) and ( 30b ) describe the appropriate reduction process if the cu(i ) of component i remains attached to the same two his residues :  \n ( 30a)2a(im)2 + 5  + e+h+1+cu(im)(h13h14)+;e(2a(im)2,h+\/cu(im)(h13h14)+,1)=0.24  v , \n ( 30b)2a(im)2 + 5  +  e+h+1+cu(im)(h14h13)+;e(2a(im)2,h+\/cu(im)(h14h13)+,1)=0.11  v. \n if , during the reduction process , the most stable cu(i ) product , 6 , is formed , the process may be modeled by ( 31 ) in which his6 is retained or by ( 32 ) in which his6 is released : \n ( 31)2a(im)2 + 5+e+h+1 + 6i(im)+im;e(2a(im)2,5,h+\/6i(im),1,im)=0.27  v , \n ( 32)2a(im)2 + 5  +  e+h+1 + 6i+2im;e(2a(im)2,5,h+\/6i,1,im)=0.37  v. \n in summary , the reduction potentials of cu(ii ) attached to the n - terminus and one or two independent his residues ( ( 30a ) and ( 30b ) ) in which the cu(i ) remains attached to the same two his residues are predicted to be slightly lower than the experimental value for cu(ii)\/a complexes , 0.30  v0.34  v. however , if the cu(i ) rearranges to include both his13 and his14 , with or without loss of his6 ( ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) , resp . ) , e values are predicted to be close to the experimental value .\ntherefore , it is possible that component i is the species that is observed to undergo reduction .  \ncomponent ii , modeled by 6(im)(h2o ) or 7 , does not involve the n - terminal asp1 .\nreduction of either species in which cu(ii ) is coordinated to his13his4 will yield the cu(i)\/hishis species , 6 , with the release of all other coordinating ligands . in the instance that cu(ii )\nis only attached to hishis except for waters ( 33 ) , an elevated value of e is obtained : \n ( 33)6(h2o)2+e6i+2h2o;e(6(h2o)2\/6i)=0.55  v. \n the high result confirms that 6(h2o)2 is also an incomplete description of the bonding in cu(ii)\/a. a more representative species is 6(im)(h2o ) , which models all three his residues coordinated to a with a coordinated water :  \n ( 34)6(im)(h2o)+e6i+im+h2o;e(6(im)(h2o)\/6i , im)=0.42  v. \n the e value ( 34 ) is close to but higher than the experimental range .\nthe species , 6(im)(h2o ) , has a coordinated water molecule which may be exchanged for another ligand . on the basis of the experimental finding that the o atom of ala2 is in the cu(ii ) coordination sphere of component ii\n, we consider here structure 7 , in which the water is replaced by an amide carbonyl , using n - methylacetamide ( nma ) as a model .\nthe reduction of 7 is described in : \n ( 35)7+e6i+im+nma;e(7\/6i , im , nma)=0.63  v. \n the e value ( 35 ) is substantially higher than the experimental range .  \nthus , it appears that none of mechanisms that involve reduction and spontaneous loss of ligands provides a satisfactory description of the reduction process .\nballand et al . , have recently carried out a detailed study of the kinetics of the reduction \/ oxidation of cu \/ a(1 - 16 ) complexes by cyclic voltametry and homogeneous transfer from osmium complexes .\nthe electron transfer rate was found to be extremely slow and required a preorganization by 22 and 16  kj  mol to geometries of the cu(ii ) and cu(i ) species , respectively , between which the actual electron transfer takes place . in the present model systems ,\nthe preorganization of the oxidized species is to release the bound carbonyl oxygen , that is , the reverse of ( 15 ) for which g \n ( 15 ) = 20  kj  mol .\nthe preorganization of the reduced species prior to oxidation is to gain the i m residue , that is , ( 27 ) for which g \n ( 27 ) = 10  kj  mol .\nscheme , the actual reduction is described by : \n ( 36)6(im)(h2o)+e6i(im)+h2o;e(6(im)(h2o)\/6i(im),h2o)=0.31  v. \n the calculated reduction potential , e(6(im)(h2o)\/6(im),h2o ) = 0.31  v , is in excellent agreement with that measured by balland et al .\n, e = 0.30  v , and the calculated free energy changes for the preorganization steps are also in good agreement .\nhigh - level ab initio electronic structure calculations were applied to models of the n - terminus of a , as well as ala2 , his6 , and his13his14 , to predict structures of the complexes of cu(ii ) and cu(i ) in water at physiological ph .\nthe calculated binding affinities of both cu(ii ) and cu(i ) to the his13his14 model , log10 \n k \n aff = 6.3 ( 13 ) and log10 \n k \n aff = 12.7 ( 24 ) , respectively , are in good agreement with experimental values , 5.6   and 14 , respectively which lends confidence to other calculated free energy changes .   at the present level of theory , cu(ii ) species\nthe one exception we found is in the case of 7 ( figure 3 ) , the proposed model for component ii of a. in 7 , two carbonyl oxygen atoms , of ala2 and his13 , occupy nearly equivalent sites in the equatorial plane of a trigonal bipyramid . on the other hand ,\nthe predominant configuration at cu(i ) in water is linear dicoordination , with the exception of cu(h2o)3 \n  and the possible exception of cu(i ) with all three his residues attached ( modeled by 6(im ) ( figure 4 ) ) which are t - shaped structures .\nit was found that asp1 forms stable complexes with cu(ii ) and two his residues , either the pair his6 , his13 , or the pair his6 , his14 , but not his13his14 , both modeled by 2a(im)2 ( figure 1 ) .\nthe complex , 2a(im)2 , represents the bonding configuration of cu(ii ) in component ia and component ib of a. each has 3n1o square planar coordination with tridentate attachment of asp1 .\nthe nh2 and co2 \n  groups contribute one of the n ligands and the o ligand in the equatorial plane , while the carbonyl o of asp1 occupies the axial position .  \nthe n - terminus does not attach to cu(ii ) if his6 and his13his14 are already attached .\nthe assignment of 7 as a model for component ii is in agreement with the findings of barnham and coworkers .\nhureau and faller and coworkers suggested that the amide nh of ala2 is deprotonated at higher ph and proposed a structure for component ii that is modeled by 4(im ) ( figure 2 ) in our study [ 6 , 7 ] .\nour results suggest that the presence of the carboxylate group of asp1 makes deprotonation of the amide group very improbable near physiological ph .\nrather , we propose that deprotonation of a protonated his residue of either his13 or his14 facilitates the formation of component ii at the expense of component i.   the binding configuration of cu(i ) to a is modeled by 6 ( figure 4 ) .\nthe cu(i ) is linearly dicoordinated to his13his14 through the n nitrogen atoms of the imidazole groups . weak coordination of his6 , as in 6(im ) , is possible in water as an endergonic process .  \nour calculations support in full the redox scheme for cu \/ a(1 - 16 ) proposed by balland et al . , which requires preorganization steps for both oxidized and reduced species .\nthe sequence of steps for reduction is described by the reverse of ( 15 ) and ( 27 ) , and ( 36 ) , which we repeat here for clarity :  \n ( 15)7+h2o6(im)(h2o)+nma;g(15)=20  kj  mol1 ;  [ 22  kj  mol1 ] , \n ( 36)6(im)(h2o)+  e6i(im)+h2o;e(6(im)(h2o)\/6i(im),h2o)=0.31  v ;  [ 0.30  v ] , \n ( 27)6i(im)6i+im;g(27)=10  kj  mol1 ;  [ 16  kj  mol1 ] . \n\nthe experimental values derived from the data of balland et al . are given in square parentheses .","abstract":" density functional and second order moller - plesset perturbation theoretical methods , coupled with a polarizable continuum model of water , were applied to determine the structures , binding affinities , and reduction potentials of cu(ii ) and cu(i ) bound to models of the asp1 , ala2 , his6 , and his13his14 regions of the amyloid beta peptide of alzheimer 's disease . \n the results indicate that the n - terminal asp binds to cu(ii ) together with his6 and either his13 or his14 to form the lower ph component i of a. component ii of a is the complex between cu(ii ) and his6 , his13 , and his14 , to which an amide o ( of ala2 ) is also coordinated . \n asp1 does not bind to cu(ii ) if three his residues are attached nor to any cu(i ) species to which one or more his residues are bound . \n the most stable cu(i ) species is one in which cu(i ) bridges the n of his13 and his14 in a linear fashion . \n cu(i ) binds more strongly to a than does cu(ii ) . \n the computed reduction potential that closely matches the experimental value for cu(ii)\/a corresponds to reduction of component ii ( without ala2 ) to the cu(i ) complex after endergonic attachment of his6 .

The air may enter through the parietotracheal fissures and enter the mediastinum by passing through the bronchial, esophageal, gastric, and esophago-tracheal fistula. Sometimes the air enters through the intercostal spaces of the rib cage [4].\nSpontaneous pneumomediastinum may also be secondary to lung parenchymal disease like tuberculosis, carcinoid syndrome, diffuse bronchiectasis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. It can also be the result of blunt or penetrating trauma, subcutaneous emphysema, foreign bodies, and iatrogenic causes. About 50% of cases are idiopathic [5].\nAlthough spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a self-limiting condition, it requires close monitoring. Early clinical evaluation and imaging should include chest X-ray, CT of the chest, or MRI.\nThe treatment includes conservative measures such as bed rest, hydration, and analgesics. Severe pneumomediastinum requires invasive measures [6].\nWe present a case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum treated conservatively and discharged after resolution of symptoms.\nWe present the case of a 56-year-old Hispanic male who developed progressive dyspnea and chest pain with sudden onset on the evening of February 26, 2011. The patient had no known allergies, no recent changes in medication, and was on daily antihypertensive and statin medications. On the day of presentation, the patient's daughter brought her to a local hospital because of shortness of breath. On initial evaluation, the patient was found to be pale, anxious, and had bilateral inspiratory crackles. The patient was noted to have a 1-day history of fever, anorexia, weight loss, chills, and nausea.\nOn physical examination, the patient was noted to have a temperature of 100.8\u00b0F, blood pressure of 116\/79 mmHg, and pulse of 88 beats per minute. Respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, pulse oximetry was 98% with oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and jugular venous pressure was 10 cm H2O with negative left parasternal lift. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory workup revealed the following: hemoglobin level of 13.6 g\/dL, white blood cell count of 9.8 cells\/\u03bcL,"}
{"article":"anti - mllerian hormone ( amh ) and inhibin b are members of the transforming growth factor  superfamily and both are expressed by the granulosa cells .\ncirculating levels of amh and inhibin b are correlated with primordial follicle recruitment , suggesting that they may be potential clinical markers for ovarian reserve .\nnumerous studies have reported that basal serum levels of amh ( 1 - 5 ) or inhibin b ( 5 - 7 ) are good predictor of ovarian response in patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation and in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) .\nseveral reports also indicate that basal serum levels of amh is a more discriminatory marker of ovarian response than basal follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) , inhibin b , or estradiol ( 8 - 10 ) .\nhowever , there were few reports addressing the clinical significance of amh and\/or inhibin b levels measured at late follicular phase during ovarian hyperstimulation .\nserum and follicular amh levels at the time of oocyte retrieval are positively correlated with the number of mature follicles and oocytes retrieved ( 11 ) .\na recent report indicated that serum amh values at the time of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) administration are also correlated significantly with the number of mature follicles , number of oocytes retrieved and serum estradiol levels ( 12 ) .\nmoreover , amh levels are correlated significantly with a greater number of 6-cell embryos and better embryo morphology score .\nserum inhibin b levels at ovulation triggering day and the levels in follicular fluids at the time of oocyte retrieval are strongly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved ( 13 ) .\nserum ( 14 ) and follicular fluid ( 15 ) levels of inhibin b at ovum pick up are also correlated positively with the number of oocytes collected and were predictive of clinical pregnancy .\nserum inhibin b levels measured around late follicular phase during ovarian hyperstimulation could predict the number of oocytes retrieved both in normal and poor responder ( 16 ) .\nsince amh is secreted mainly in preantral and early small antral follicle ( 17 , 18 ) , the circulating amh level decreases through maturing follicle in normal menstrual cycle , and further decreases in fsh - treated cycles ( 19 - 21 ) . in ovarian hyperstimulation and ivf cycles , however , continued recruitment of additional antral follicles during the stimulatory phase results in higher amh levels , thus it may be related with the number of mature follicles and number of oocytes retrieved .\nin contrast to amh , inhibin b rises from early follicular phase to reach a peak during mid - follicular phase ( 22 ) but continues to increase during ovarian hyperstimulation ( 16 ) .\nthis suggests that inhibin b is secreted by the developing cohort of antral follicles ( 23 ) .\nfollicular pool at late follicular phase encompasses various stages of follicular development during ovarian hyperstimulation .\ntherefore , amh and inhibin b levels at late follicular phase could reflect overall ovarian pool , including small and large antral and mature follicles .\nhowever , follicular amh levels were reported to be three times higher in small follicles ( < 12 mm ) than large follicles ( > 16 mm ) and serum amh levels were tightly correlated with the follicular levels ( 11 ) .\nthese findings suggest that serum amh levels more reflect small antral follicular pool , thus we postulated serum amh levels at ovulation triggering day could be related with the number of immature oocytes obtained .\nalthough previous studies by other researchers demonstrated that serum amh ( 12 ) or inhibin b ( 13 , 16 ) values at the time of hcg administration correlated significantly with the number of oocytes retrieved , they described only the number of total or mature oocytes .\nthe aim of this study was to investigate whether serum levels of amh and\/or inhibin b at ovulation triggering day correlate with the number of immature oocytes obtained from stimulated ivf cycles .\nfifty - nine ivf cycles from 45 infertile couples were recruited in which at least one oocyte was obtained between may 2005 and november 2006 .\nthe characteristics of the study subjects were presented in table 1 . only women with tubal ( n=18 ) or unexplained infertility ( n=27 ) were included .\novulatory factor such as polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) was entirely excluded since women with pcos may have unusually higher serum amh levels during ovarian hyperstimulation ( 21 ) .\nwe obtained an approval from institutional review board of seoul national university bundang hospital for the measurement of amh and inhibin b from patients ' frozen sera .\novarian hyperstimulation was performed using recombinant fsh ( rfsh , gonal - f , serono , geneva , switzerland ) ( 31 cycles ) or combination of rfsh with urinary hmg ( menogon , ferring , malmo , sweden in 11 cycles , and pergonal , serono in 15 cycles ) .\nwhen mature leading follicle reached 14 mm in diameter , gnrh antagonist ( cetrotide , serono ) 0.25 mg \/ d was started until hcg administration .\nwhen mature leading follicle(s ) reached 19 mm in diameter , recombinant hcg ( ovidrel , serono ) 0.25 mg was given for final ovulation triggering and then oocytes were retrieved 35 - 36 hr later . during the study period , almost all follicles\nover 10 mm in diameter were aspirated strictly . in conventional ivf cycles ( n=25 ) , the maturity of oocytes was initially assessed by their morphological criteria in reference of cumulus cells .\nwhen immature oocytes were suspected , they were treated with phosphated buffered saline ( pbs ) solution including 0.1% hyaluronidase ( cook , brisbane , australia ) , and then , the cumulus cells were removed mechanically by pipetting . in intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) cycles ( n=34 ) , cumulus - enclosed oocytes were treated with 0.1% hyaluronidase , and the cumulus cells were removed mechanically by pipetting .\nfinally , immature oocytes were defined by the absence of the first polar body , and then classified as germinal vesicle ( gv ) or metaphase i stage depending on visible gv .\nthe mature oocyte was determined as a presence of the first polar body under the stereomicroscope .\nimmature oocytes were cultured ( mi oocytes for 4 hr and gv up to 44 hr ) in organ culture dish containing 1 ml of each g2 medium ( vitrolife , kungsbacka , sweden ) at 37 , 5% co2 with high humidity . if matured , they were fertilized by icsi .\nnormal fertilization was confirmed when two distinct pronuclei were present 16 - 18 hr later .\nthe cleaved embryos with good quality , either from in vivo or in vitro matured oocytes , were transferred transcervically 3 days after insemination .\nblood samples were collected on the day of hcg administration , and serum aliquots were immediately separated , then frozen at -80 till assay .\nthe concentrations of serum estradiol were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit ( tke21 , diagnostic products corporation , u.s.a . ) .\namh and inhibin b concentrations were measured by sensitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( mis \/ amh ; dsl-10 - 14400 , inhibin b ; dsl-10 - 84100i , diagnostic systems laboratories , webster , texas , u.s.a . ) .\nthe sensitivity of amh was < 0.017 ng \/ ml and the intra - assay coefficient of variation ( cv ) was 4.6% at 0.144 ng \/ ml .\nthe sensitivity of inhibin b was < 7 pg \/ ml and the intra - assay cv was 5.6% at 472 pg \/ ml .\napproximately one third of the retrieved oocytes were immature oocyte in our series ( 33.7% , 144\/427 ) .\nthe overall maturation and fertilization rate for immature oocyte was 56.9% ( 82\/144 ) and 61.0% ( 50\/82 ) , respectively .\nup to five embryos were transferred and the resultant pregnancy rate was 25.9% per transfer ( 15\/58 ) . between pregnant and non - pregnant cycles , there were no differences in oocytes number and serum levels of amh , inhibin b or estradiol .\nunivariate analysis revealed that the number of immature as well as mature oocytes was positively correlated with serum amh , inhibin b and estradiol levels , respectively ( table 2 ) . in serum amh and inhibin\nb , the correlation coefficients for immature oocyte were slightly higher than those for mature oocyte .\namh levels had a strong positive correlation with inhibin b. either amh or inhibin b levels were correlated positively with estradiol levels . there was no relation between mature and immature oocyte count . since serum levels of amh , inhibin b and estradiol may reflect overall oocyte pool including mature ( mo ) and immature oocytes ( i m ) , we tested multiple regressions and the following equations were generated .\namh ( ng \/ ml)=0.1312 + 0.0874 [ mo]+0.1417 [ i m ] ( r=0.5424 , p=0.008 ) inhibin b ( pg \/ ml)=-188.7851 + 130.5844 [ mo]+235.8635 [ i m ] ( r=0.7318 , p=0.022 ) estradiol ( pg \/ ml)=234.1401 + 118.9406 [ mo]+87.0733 [ i m ] ( r=0.6593 , p=0.014 ) multiple regressions showed that numbers of mature and immature oocytes were still independently correlated with three markers .\nmultiple regressions also indicated that all of three markers could reflect the combined pool of mature and immature oocytes with a statistical significance .\nthese equations also indicate serum amh and inhibin b levels measured on triggering day were more closely related with the immature oocyte count than mature oocyte count in ivf cycle .\nour results clearly demonstrated that the number of immature as well as mature oocytes is independently correlated with serum amh and inhibin b levels measured on ovulation triggering day .\nvery interestingly , the correlation coefficients from univariate analysis were higher in the number of immature oocytes than number of mature oocytes .\nthis means that the number of immature oocytes have a better correlation with serum amh and inhibin b levels .\nwe could generate multiple regression equations in the hypothesis that number of retrieved oocytes represents follicular pool at the time of oocyte retrieval . from the equations\n, we found again that number of immature oocytes could be a better contributor to determine serum levels of amh and inhibin b. although previous studies by other researchers demonstrated that serum values of amh ( 12 ) or inhibin b ( 13 , 16 ) at the time of ovulation triggering correlate significantly with the number of oocytes retrieved , they did not describe the number of immature oocytes separately .\nour findings are in agreement with those of the previous studies in that serum amh or inhibin b at ovulation triggering day have a significant positive correlation with the number of total or mature oocytes collected .\nmoreover , we found for the first time that serum levels of amh and inhibin b could be good predictors to determine the number of immature oocytes retrieved in ivf cycles . at the time of ovulation triggering , follicular pool with various sizes exists within ovary . during ovarian stimulation , the oocyte population at the time of hcg may be heterogeneous and this leads to retrieval of oocytes at different stages of maturation .\nimmature oocytes at the time of oocyte retrieval may be originated from small antral follicles or from large preovulatory follicles unresponsive to hcg . in one study ,\n61.8% of immature oocytes are obtained from small antral follicles ( 7 - 12 mm ) and the remaining from larger follicles ( > 12 mm ) ( 24 ) . in ivf cycles ,\nalthough they represent a compromised group with low developmental competence , those are valuable source for surplus oocytes if they can be matured in vitro .\nthe clinical use of oocytes matured in vitro for ivf is more important especially in poor responders ; thereby the needs for development of in vitro maturation are increasing ( 25 ) . in the present study ,\n33.7% of oocytes were retrieved as immature form . this higher rate might be principally attributed to our strict policy to puncture all follicles over 10 mm in diameter during the period of study .\na slightly higher immaturity was reported in gnrh antagonist cycles compared to gnrh agonist cycles ( 24 ) .\nwe also found a strong positive correlation between serum concentrations of amh and inhibin b at ovulation triggering day .\nthese strong correlations indicate that growing follicular pool produces amh , inhibin b as well as estradiol into the circulation , and thus suggest that serum amh and inhibin b give no additive information over conventional measurement of serum estradiol levels .\nserum amh and inhibin b may be valuable in that these protein markers represent preferentially immature oocyte count , as shown by our study . in the present study ,\nthe mean serum level of amh at ovulation triggering day was 0.90 ng \/ ml ( range : 0.05 - 2.99 ng \/ ml ) and this was quite lower than 2.7 ng \/ ml ( range : 0 - 28.5 ng \/ ml ) reported by silberstein et al .\n( 12 ) however , it can not be directly compared since the method of measurement was different .\nwe used elisa kits purchased from diagnostic systems laboratories ( dsl ) , and it was reported that amh levels are almost 4.6-fold lower with the dsl kit compared to the beckman coulter kit ( 26 ) .\none study using the beckman coulter kit reported the median serum level of amh was 1.44 ng \/ ml on the day of oocyte retrieval ( range : 0.38 - 4.96 ng \/ ml ) ( 11 ) .\nserum amh levels on the day of oocyte retrieval may be lower than those in ovulation triggering day because hcg - induced luteinization curtails follicular amh production ( 27 ) .\ntherefore , serum amh values may be different according to the time of measurement and the elisa kits used . in conclusion\n, our study demonstrated that the number of immature as well as mature oocytes retrieved in stimulated ivf cycles is independently correlated with serum amh and inhibin b levels measured on ovulation triggering day .\nour results also indicate that serum amh and inhibin b levels on triggering day are more closely related with immature oocyte count , thus serum levels of amh and inhibin b seem to be good predictors to determine the immature oocyte count in ivf cycle .","abstract":" the aim of this study was to investigate whether serum levels of anti -

acting factor yy1 and that the unique a - allele of the variant can neutralise the \n reduced expression that is mediated by the oa - associated t - allele of rs143383 ( ref .\nthis result again demonstrates that the activity \n of a susceptibility allele is context - specific whereas yy1 , such as sp1 , sp3 , p15 and \n deaf-1 , is a trans - acting factor that can modulate gdf5 expression and \n which could therefore be exploited to potentially alleviate the oa risk coded for by this \n gene . in their c - allele forms\nsuch sites are potentially \n amenable to epigenetic regulation by dna methylation . since epigenetic mechanisms are known \n to play a role in chondrogenesis and oa pathogenesis ( refs 38 , 39 ) it was hypothesised that rs143383 \n and rs143384 may be targets for epigenetic control and that was indeed shown to be the case \n ( ref .\nmethylation of the gdf5 \n 5utr was demonstrated to occur in cell lines and in joint tissues , with demethylation \n leading to increased gdf5 expression .\nin a cell line heterozygous for \n rs143383 , this demethylation was found to exacerbate the aei mediated by rs143383 .\nthis \n result clearly demonstrated that the genetic effect that rs143383 has on \n gdf5 expression is modifiable by nongenetic factors .\nthere are as yet no animal models directly targeting the gdf5 snps \n discussed above .\nhowever , the brachypodism mouse has offered an opportunity to assess what \n effect a reduction in gdf5 has on joint physiology .\nthe brachypodism mutation is a frame \n shift of gdf5 that causes a premature termination codon , resulting in a \n null allele .\nhomozygotes display a number of musculoskeletal defects whereas heterozygotes \n show no such developmental abnormalities but are at risk of developing an oa phenotype when \n challenged ( ref .\n41 ) . by being subjected to a \n reduction rather than a total loss of gdf5\nthe brachypodism heterozygote \n mimics the effect of rs143383 in human oa and emphasises the need to maintain appropriate \n levels of gdf5 to ensure healthy joint function .\nthere have been published reports on the functional analysis of other oa loci , with \n particularly insightful data generated recently for the 7q22 signal from the rotterdam study \n and for dio2 . as mentioned earlier ,\nthe rotterdam study reported an association signal to a region of \n chromosome 7q22 encompassing six known protein - coding genes ( table 3 ) .\nthe expression of these genes was assessed using cells \n extracted and cultured from the joint tissues of oa patients .\nthe results revealed that all \n the genes showed a near universal expression pattern , apart from gpr22 \n ( refs 21 , 25 ) . a subsequent study that examined the expression of the genes using rna directly \n extracted from patient joint tissues discovered that genotype at the 7q22 association signal \n correlated with expression of hbp1 in cartilage ( ref .\nit would appear likely therefore that part , or all , of the 7q22 \n association signal is accounted for by a regulatory polymorphism that modulates \n hbp1 expression .\ndio2 codes for iodothyronine - deiodinase enzyme type 2 ( d2 ) , a \n selenoprotein that converts intracellular inactive thyroid hormone to its active form .\na \n common dio2 haplotype composed of the c - allele of snp rs225014 and the \n c - allele of snp rs12885300 is associated with oa in europeans and asians ( ref .\nan analysis of dio2 expression revealed that the gene was subject to aei \n with the c - allele of rs225014 correlating with increased expression in cartilage ( ref .\nfurthermore , immunohistochemistry revealed an \n increased amount of d2 positive cells in oa versus healthy cartilage .\nthese results suggest \n that modulating the level of active thyroid hormone in joint tissues , via the increased \n expression of dio2 and the subsequent availability of d2 , is a contributing \n factor in oa aetiology .\nmethylation analysis of cpg sites within and close to \n dio2 in both oa diseased cartilage and intact cartilage have revealed that , \n as for gdf5 , the gene is also subjected to epigenetic regulation related to \n disease status ( ref .\ngdf5 , hbp1 and dio2 are all examples of \n where the oa risk allele mediates its effect by altering gene expression . as more \n susceptibility loci\nare identified for common human diseases it is becoming apparent that \n the majority of associated alleles contribute to disease risk by influencing gene \n expression , typically by modulating rates of transcription or of transcript stability ( ref . \n 45 ) .\noa genetic susceptibility is following this \n trend and as such the initial functional test on all new oa signals should be an assessment \n of the effect that the risk allele has on gene expression .\none of the early translational aims of the genetic investigation of common complex diseases \n was that it would offer a predictive capacity to clinicians in their attempts to identify \n individuals at risk of disease initiation and progression .\nhowever , it has become apparent \n that the vast majority of disease risk alleles contribute individually only very modestly to \n heritability and as such there is limited current scope for their use as predictive tools \n ( ref .\n46 ) . clearly , this scenario is likely to \n change as more risk alleles are identified ( see below ) but for the vast majority of diseases \n this is realistically a medium term goal at best .\nalternatively , by identifying the \n principal pathways that are the recipients of genetic susceptibility then there is scope for \n exploiting these insights for new treatment development .\nas yet the number of oa risk loci \n is quite small but it does appear from the list of genes in tables 1 and 3 that \n regulation of cell differentiation could be one of the key pathways for future \n exploitation .\none of the clear messages to have emerged from the gwass performed on common diseases is \n that the case - control sample sizes used have to be large in order to detect what are small \n individual contributions from the risk alleles . of the three gwass listed in table 2 only arcogen had adequate sample size\nif additional novel oa signals are to be \n discovered , it is critical that genotyping at the genome - wide level continues on all \n available samples and with the concurrent use of meta - analyses . the number of oa cases will \n also need to be expanded to provide the power to account for susceptibility differences \n between ethnic groups , between the two sexes and between different joints ; without case \n sample sizes in the tens of thousands the vast majority of oa susceptibility alleles will go \n undetected .\nit has also become evident that rare variants can also contribute to common \n disease risk ( refs 47 , 48 ) and that these are often not captured by the current gwas arrays . \n as such imputation , re - sequencing and exome and whole - genome analyses ( ref .\n49 ) are likely to have a role in the discovery of rare \n risk alleles for oa .\noa genetic studies have quite sensibly focused on clinical forms of the disease but it is \n becoming apparent that breakthroughs can also be achieved by studying alternative but \n related phenotypes and a very clear example of this has recently been published .\nthe \n rotterdam group who discovered the 7q22 locus subsequently examined joint - space width ( jsw ) \n at the hip in their population cohorts ( ref .\na \n gwas was performed and an association was detected with snp rs12982744 , with a \n p - value of 1.1    10 .\nthe g - allele of the snp was associated \n with an increase in jsw and a secondary analysis revealed that this allele also correlated \n with a reduced risk of hip oa .\nthe p - value for the oa association was more \n modest than that for jsw , at 1.0    10 , but the principle was clearly \n established that the use of a proxy phenotype can further our understanding of oa . \n\nas the name implies , this \n enzyme is a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine-79 of histone h3 . using the \n mouse atdc5 chondrogenesis model and micromass cultures the investigators demonstrated that \n knockdown of dot1l leads to reduced proteoglycan and collagen content and \n that this may be mediated by modulation of the wnt signalling pathway .\npain is a symptom of clinical oa and has been considered a logical therapeutic target for \n oa treatment .\nhowever , the current clinical trial data on the use of targeted pain biologics \n have revealed that adverse events can outweigh any benefits of managing oa pain ( ref .\nnevertheless , there have been several reports \n testing for genetic association between known pain loci and oa pain , including to the genes \n p2rx7 , pace4 and trpv1 ( refs 52 , 53 , 54 ) . in comparison with the oa\ngwas studies discussed \n above , the significant p - values obtained were relatively modest . despite \n this , these studies do support a more comprehensive and powered analysis of the genetics of \n oa pain .\ngene expression microarray analyses provide an opportunity to assess which particular \n pathways are implicated in disease initiation and progression , or in the establishment of a \n particular cell type . as such\nthey have enhanced our understanding of oa pathogenesis and \n table 5 provides details of six such recent \n studies including a summary of their key findings ( refs 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 ) .\none clear conclusion is that \n gene expression varies qualitatively and quantitatively between cartilage collected from \n different skeletal sites , such as the knees and the hips ( refs 57 , 58 ) .\nthis is reminiscent \n of the genetic discovery discussed earlier of oa risk alleles rarely being systemic in their \n effects and often showing joint - specific effects .\nthe microarrays have also highlighted \n genes that show significant up- or down - regulation in oa and several of the genes from \n within the arcogen signals are among these , including col12a1 , \n myo6 , chst11 and pappa . in the future , \n rna sequencing ( rnaseq )\nwill supersede microarrays , as it offers a number of advantages \n including the ability to discover novel transcripts and alternative splice forms ( refs 61 , 62 ) .\na \n natural progression from gene expression is proteomic analysis but this is only now \n receiving the detailed and comprehensive attention that it deserves .\ninvestigators have , for \n example , characterised the protein profiles in the joint tissues and fluids of oa patients \n and then compared these with the profiles from healthy groups and from patients with a \n different joint disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis ( refs 63 , 64 ) .\nthe aim has been to enlighten our understanding of the pathophysiology of the \n disease and to assist in the identity of biomarkers that may be used to assess disease \n status and disease progression ( ref .\nit is \n clear from these studies that there are significant differences between the oa and the \n non - oa proteome profiles and that some of the protein differences are detectable in \n accessible fluids such as urine , which makes their use in future clinical trials of oa \n therapeutics a realistic possibility .\ntable 5.recent global gene -

{"article":"shoulder pain is a very common complaint , and several major etiologies include rotator cuff injury , adhesive capsulitis , shoulder instability , and arthritis.1 however , one should not exclude the possibility of referred pain from another anatomic location .\nthe documented potential sources of referred pain to the shoulder include cervical spondylolysis , cervical arthritis , cervical disc disease , myocardial ischemia , diaphragmatic irritation , reflex sympathetic dystrophy , thoracic outlet syndrome , and gallbladder disease.2 it is very important to accurately identify the underlying etiology in order to effectively treat shoulder pain .\nthymic carcinoma is a rare carcinoma arising from the thymic epithelium presenting with highly malignant features such as adjacent tissue invasion and metastases.3 it represents less than 1% of thymic tumors , but often presents with advanced disease upon diagnosis , with a reported 5-year survival of 30%50%.3,4 typical initial presentations of thymic carcinoma include cough , chest pain , phrenic nerve palsy , or superior vena cava syndrome ; these features can also be identified as incidental findings.3 we report a case with chronic right shoulder pain as the initial major symptom of thymic carcinoma .\nincidentally , shoulder pain has long been a recognized feature of referred pain from phrenic nerve pathology and diaphragmatic irritation.5 although the association between shoulder pain and the existence of a neoplasm has been previously described,6,7 we were unable to identify this occurrence in english - language based literature search .\na 48-year - old male with no systemic disease or trauma history visited his family physician s clinic at a teaching hospital for recurrent right shoulder pain , which had been bothering him for approximately 6 months .\nthe pain intensity measured on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale ( nrs)8 was 56\n. physical examination of the right shoulder revealed that the pain was located at the upper portion of right trapezius muscle , with local tenderness over this area .\nthe range of motion , manual muscle testing , and sensation of right shoulder region were all within normal limits .\nthe supraspinatus tendinitis test , apley scratch test , speed s test , hawkins - mennedy test , and lippman s test were all negative .\nmyofascial trigger points ( mtrps ) were identified in the right supraspinatus muscle , right infraspinatus muscle , right upper trapezius muscle and right lower trapezius muscle . under the impression that soft tissue injury was the cause of his pain , he received conservative treatment . however , the patient responded poorly to medication and physical therapy .\nfive months later , he visited a neurosurgeon , who arranged a magnetic resonance image ( mri ) of the cervical spine , which revealed multiple mild herniated intervertebral discs , including c3\/4 , c4\/5 , and c6\/7 , with posterior compression to the spinal cord .\nthus , the patient received anterior disectomies at c4\/5 and c5\/6 and interbody fusion of c4\/5 , c5\/6 with polyetheretherketone cages .\nunfortunately , the pain did not improve after the surgery , so he visited a physiatry clinic , where mtrps were identified in the right upper trapezius muscle , right lower trapezius muscle , right rhomboid major and minor muscles , and right infraspinatus muscle .\nmtrps were identified based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) exquisite painful spot in a taut band , ( 2 ) pain recognition at the spot , ( 3 ) typical referred pain pattern.9,10 therefore , trigger points injection was performed , which relieved his shoulder pain for several days .\ndue to new - onset and progressively worsening dull chest pain , additional diagnostic studies were performed . a chest x - ray revealed enlargement of the right hilum when compared with previous films ( figure 1 ) .\ncomputed tomography ( ct ) disclosed an anterior mediastinal tumor ( figure 2 ) , and thymic carcinoma was suspected .\nafter a ct - guided biopsy , squamous cell carcinoma of thymic origin was confirmed .\nwithin a few days , the patient received total resection of mediastinal tumor and operative findings revealed a large , white , solid , and hard tumor containing a fibrotic change approximately 10 cm 9 cm 5 cm in size with invasion to pericardial membrane , right phrenic nerve , and right side parietal pleura .\nthe pathologic sections from total resection of the thymus showed thymic carcinoma with epitheloid tumor cells , nuclear pleomorphism , apparent nucleoli , and mitotic feature in a solid nest or sheet arrangement ( figure 3 ) .\nimmunohistochemical analysis showed positive cytokeratin , positive c - kit ( cd117 ) , and negative leukocyte common antigen ( lca ) in the tumor cells , which is consistent with thymic carcinoma .\nafter the surgery , the patient achieved significant relief of the right shoulder pain ( to nrs 23 ) and chest pain .\nhe underwent scheduled chemotherapy and radiation therapy thereafter . during follow -

thoracotomy ipsilateral shoulder pain due to irritation of the pericardium or mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces;1517 ( 2 ) post laparoscopic shoulder pain after various laparoscopic surgical procedures due to overstretching of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers induced by the pressure of the pneumoperitoneum;12,18 or ( 3 ) shoulder pain as a symptom of lung cancer with intrathoracic injury of the phrenic nerve and its relief by mediastinal irradiation.5 in this case report , the clinical mechanism of shoulder pain was very similar to the third situation described above . however , we were unable to identify literature written in english regarding thymic carcinoma with shoulder pain as the initial clinical manifestation , except for one case.19 in that case , the author reported a case of thymic carcinoma with left shoulder pain lasting for two years without other major symptoms before diagnosis . unfortunately , however , the topic of the article focused on medicolegal issues , and there was no further discussion regarding the correlation between shoulder pain and thymic carcinoma .\nthis extremely limited documentation may be due to the rarity of thymic carcinoma , its aggressiveness and its poor prognosis.20 the most common initial presentations of thymic carcinoma include chest pain , shortness of breath , cough , superior vena cava syndrome , or phrenic nerve palsy due to direct compression or invasion of the tumor mass . in some patients ,\nthymic carcinomas were incidentally found during routine chest radiographs.3,4 other nonspecific symptoms include malaise , weight loss , fatigue , fever , and anorexia.21,22 rarely , paraneoplastic syndrome and myasthenia gravis were reported in well - differentiated thymic carcinomas.4 in most instances , invasion of adjacent mediastinal structures or metastatic spread had already occurred at the time of diagnosis of thymic carcinoma.4,20 notably , our patient also experienced superimposed myofascial pain ( pain due to mtrp ) and cervical discogenic pain .\na review of previous literature revealed that the most frequent site of referred pain via phrenic nerve is around the lateral third of the trapezius border , extending to the acromion.23 this area overlapped with the referred pain pattern of several trigger points of trapezius muscle proposed by simons et al,9 and the pain referral map of c4\/5 , c5\/6 , c6\/7 intervertebral discs proposed by slipman et al,24 and the pain referral from c5\/6 , c6\/7 facet joints proposed by dwyer et al25 ( figure 4 ) .\nafter suffering from right shoulder pain for five months , the patient received discectomies for c4\/5 , c5\/6 with interbody fusion because the origin of pain from herniated intervertebral discs c4\/5 and c5\/6 were revealed by mri . unfortunately , the tumor mass did not appear on the mri at that time since the non - contrast mri conducted before surgery was focused on the c - spine , in which the lowest spinal level was shown only to t3 . however , chest ct with contrast conducted eight months later revealed that the highest level of the anterior mediastinal mass began approximately at the t5 level . additionally , the mass was likely smaller before disc surgery .\nthe patient received trigger point injections , which relieved the pain according to the patient . in the perspective of myofascial pain syndrome\n, hong has proposed the hypothesis that a persistent or recurrent trigger point is typically caused by an underlying lesion other than the muscle itself.26,27 therefore , it is possible that the phrenic nerve lesion caused by thymic carcinoma can also elicit pain due to mtrp .\nin such a case , identifying and treating the etiological lesion to eliminate chronic pain remains very useful and crucial .\nthe purpose of this report is to document our experience of shoulder pain as a symptom of referred pain from thymic carcinoma due to phrenic nerve invasion , which may be very similar to myofascial pain syndrome , pain from a cervical disc , or referred pain from the zygapophyseal joint .\nchronic shoulder pain may be an initial major manifestation of thymic carcinoma likely due to phrenic nerve or pericardium involvement , and this type of pain may be similar to myofascial pain syndrome , neurogenic pain from a cervical disc , and referred pain from the zygapophyseal joint . with the correct diagnosis , the treating physician can solve the patient s pain problem rather than providing symptomatic treatment .\nwe hope that our clinical experience may assist other physicians who diagnose and treat shoulder pain .","abstract":" we report a case of thymic carcinoma presenting as unilateral shoulder pain for 13 months . \n before an accurate diagnosis was made , the patient received conservative treatment , cervical discectomies , and myofascial trigger point injection , none of which relieved his pain . when thymic carcinoma was eventually diagnosed , he received total resection of the tumor and the shoulder pain subsided completely . \n thymic carcinoma is a rare carcinoma , and our review of the literature did not show shoulder pain as its initial presentation except for one case report . \n the purpose of this report is to document our clinical experience so that other physiatrists can include thymic carcinoma in their differential diagnosis of shoulder pain .

{"article":"cellular resistance \n to anticancer agents constitutes a major obstacle \n in the successful chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers with multidrug \n resistance ( mdr ) being responsible for failure in > 90% of metastatic \n cancer patients . over the last few decades \n the notions of tumor heterogeneity and cancer stem cells have transformed \n our understanding of cancer and chemoresistance .\npreviously , tumors \n were depicted using the clonal evolution model as a collection of \n homogeneous cancer cells , with little variation , that had equal potential \n to initiate and propagate tumorgenesis\n. however , current research \n depicts tumors as hierarchically organized with intratumor heterogeneity \n giving rise to a subclass of cells with increased ability to initiate \n tumor formation .\nthis subclass of cells , \n referred to as tumor - initiating cells or cancer stem cells ( cscs ) , \n was initially reported by bonnet and dick in 1997 and since then has been isolated in various types of cancers \n including breast cancer , ovarian cancer , acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , \n glioblastoma , and pancreatic cancer , among others .\nfurthermore , it has been shown that cscs play a major role \n in resistance through a variety of acquired and intrinsic mechanisms \n that include overexpression of atp - binding cassette ( abc ) efflux transporters \n and detoxification enzymes , increased ability to repair dna , down - regulation \n of apoptotic pathways , and changes in the cell cycle kinetics and \n microenvironment .\none of many reported contributing factors to csc resistance and \n mdr is the overexpression of a class of efflux pumps belonging to \n the abc superfamily of proteins .\nresistance is conferred from abc \n proteins by their ability to specifically efflux chemotherapeutic \n agents out of cells and may contribute to resistance in cscs .\ninitially , \n abc transporters , particularly p - glycoprotein ( p - gp , abcb1 ) , emerged as a promising strategy for directly \n addressing the mechanism of mdr and has been actively pursued for \n the past 30 years . while several reasons \n for the clinical failure of this approach have been put forward , an \n overarching problem of targeting p - gp\np - gp is expressed in many tissue types ( e.g. , intestine , kidney , liver , \n placenta , blood  brain barrier ) and plays an important role \n in xenobiotic transport .\nowing to its critical , protective role , a \n safer strategy would focus on targeting abc transporters upregulated \n in cscs and mdr cancers but whose inhibition would not prove toxic \n to the organism .\nblockade or inhibition \n of these abc transporters may prove to be novel targets to overcome \n chemoresistance .\nthe taxanes are a class of chemotherapeutic \n agents affected by \n cscs and mdr that are widely used in the treatment of breast cancer .\nseveral abc transporters , including p - gp and \n abcc10 , are known to efflux anticancer agents such as taxanes out \n of cancer cells . moreover , in vitro studies \n and a recent in vivo study have shown unambiguously that abcc10 overexpression \n confers resistance to taxanes .\nimportantly , in recently published \n work , it was shown that abcc10 is expressed in 100% of her2-positive , \n 85% of her2-negative , and 64% of triple - negative breast cancer tumor \n samples .\nfurthermore , it was shown that abcc10-null mammary tumors \n are sensitized to taxanes and that there is a significant increase \n in survival in abcc10 mice compared to \n wild - type counterparts following docetaxel treatment .\nintriguingly , it was also shown that abcc10 affects multiple \n parameters of breast tumor biology relevant to disease progression , \n including metastasis , proliferation , and migration . these data and \n another recently published report support the idea that abc transporters \n impact tumor biology , which drives other mechanisms of resistance \n outside of drug efflux , including their \n roles in cancer initiation and propagation , thus supporting their validity as drug targets . selective , potent \n inhibitors of abcc10 that possess a lower affinity for\np - gp would \n enable the resensitization of tumors to chemotherapeutic ( e.g. , taxanes ) . \n\ncurrently , there are only a few inhibitors of abcc10 , the most potent \n inhibitor to date being cepharanthine . moreover ,\nnone of these inhibitors \n are specific for abcc10 over other efflux pumps , such as p - gp ( abcb1 ) . over 75% of chemotherapeutic agents employed\nkam and co - workers isolated novel \n pentacyclic strychnos alkaloids alstolucines \n a  f , from alstonia spatulata ( figure 1 ) . in \n addition , they were evaluated for their ability to resensitize vincristine - resistant \n kb cells , which overexpress p - gp . structurally , the alstolucines are \n closely related to the classical strychnos alkaloid akuammicine ( 1 ) , which we have prepared by \n total synthesis in both racemic and asymmetric \n form .\nwe reasoned that these complex \n pentacyclic strychnos alkaloids , while \n structurally related , would inhibit abcb1 ( p - gp ) and abcc10 to varying \n extents , allowing us to obtain valuable structure  activity \n relationship data and accordingly develop potent and selective inhibitors \n for the latter over the former . structures of ( )-akuammicine ( 1 ) and novel \n pentacyclic strychnos alkaloids ( )-alstolucine \n b ( 2 ) , ( )-alstolucine f ( 3 ) , ( )-n - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) , and ( )-alstolucine \n a ( 5 ) . to determine the capacity \n of these novel alkaloids to reverse abcc10 \n mdr and their affinity for p - gp , we prepared 25 by asymmetric total synthesis from ( )-1 and evaluated their biological activity .\nspecifically , we measured \n the inhibitory effect of 25 on ( 1 ) \n abcc10 atpase activity , ( 2 ) p - gp atpase activity , and ( 3 ) the ability \n of 15 to resensitize abcc10-transfected \n cell lines to paclitaxel .\nthe \n asymmetric total syntheses of alkaloids 15 are outlined in scheme 1 . utilizing \n the methodology of yus and co -

metathesis \n of 9 and methyl acrylate in the presence \n of 10 mol % hoveyda  grubbs second - generation catalyst gave \n enoate 10 in 80% yield .\ninspired \n by ellman s elegant work on ( )-aurantioclavine , we employed a novel bis - cyclization protocol \n wherein the pentacyclic e - ring was closed using mitsunobu conditions , \n followed by treatment with dbu to cyclize the c - ring and access tetracycle 11 in 56% yield .\nremoval of the n - boc group with tfa and subsequent alkylation with ( z)-2-iodobutenyl bromide and potassium \n carbonate afforded 12 in 71% yield .\nheck cyclization \n of 12 using pd(oac)2 , pph3 , and \n et3n , which was inspired by rawal s elegant approach \n to the strychnos alkaloids , accessed the d - ring to deliver ( )-akuammicine \n ( 1 ) in 87% yield ( 10% overall yield in nine steps ) . with 1 in hand\n, we were tempted \n to employ an anti - markovnikov \n hydroboration \/ carbinol oxidation sequence to access alstolucine b \n ( 2 ) in two steps from 1 . however\n, levy and \n co - workers had shown that the hydroboration of 1 proceeds \n in a markovnikov manner , affording the tertiary carbinol product . in the light of this\n, we reasoned that a viable \n alternative route to 25 would feature \n ( 1 ) dihydroxylation of the c20c19 double bond , ( 2 ) oxidation \n of the diol to install the requisite ketone functionality at c19 , \n and ( 3 ) a deoxygenation of the acyloin intermediate to deliver the \n alstolucines . toward this end ,\nacetylation of the tertiary c20 \n alcohol using standard conditions furnished acetate 15 in 95% yield .\nreductive removal of the o - acetate \n moiety in 15 was realized using molander s method \n of smi2 in thf at 78 c to afford alstolucine \n b ( 2 , 44% ) and alstolucine f ( 3 , 27% ) in \n a 1.6:1 ratio , which were separable by flash column silica gel chromatography .\nstereoselective luche reduction of alstolucine \n f ( 3 ) afforded n - demethylalstogucine \n ( 4 ) in 87% yield .\nacylation \n of the newly formed alcohol using clco2et and et3n furnished alstolucine a ( 5 ) in 73% yield .\nalternatively , \n the stereoselective reduction of alstolucine b ( 2 ) yielded \n echitamidine ( 16 ) in 85% . to determine if compounds 25 and \n intermediate compounds inhibited \n abcc10 atpase activities , we performed atpase assays using end point \n inorganic phosphate as previously described .\nas depicted in figure 2 , we have shown that \n alstolucines b ( 2 ) and f ( 3 ) inhibited abcc10 \n 4050% at 12.5 and 50 m , respectively .\nall other compounds \n tested showed modest to no inhibition of abcc10 . the effect of pentacyclic strychnos alkaloids on abcc10 atpase activity .\nthe \n ability of alstolucines \n and demethylalstogucine to inhibit abcc10 atpase activity was tested \n using a range of concentrations of alstolucine a ( 5 ) , \n alstolucine b ( 2 ) , alstolucine f ( 3 ) , and n - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) .\nalstolucine b ( 2 ) and alstolucine f ( 3 ) showed the best inhibition \n ( 4050% ) at 12.5 and 50 m , respectively .\natpase activity assays were run in a similar matter \n to test inhibition of p - gp as depicted in figure 3 .\nit was determined that alstolucines a ( 5 ) , \n b ( 2 ) , and f ( 3 ) do not inhibit p - gp , while n - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) inhibits p - gp ( 3537% ) \n at 2.08 and 6.25 m . in comparison to cepharanthine ( i.e. , the \n best inhibitor of abcc10 to date ) , alstolucines b ( 2 ) \n and f ( 3 ) are more potent inhibitors in abcc10 atpase \n assays ( 50% inhibition versus 20% inhibition )\n; however , they selectively \n inhibit abcc10 over p - gp , unlike cepharanthine and other known inhibitors \n of abcc10 .\nthe ability of alstolucines \n and demethylalstogucine to inhibit abcb1 atpase activity was tested \n using a range of concentrations of alstolucine a ( 5 ) , \n alstolucine b ( 2 ) , alstolucine f ( 3 ) , and n - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) .\nn - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) showed the only inhibition \n ( 3537% ) at 2.08 and 6.25 m , respectively .\nwe previously determined the resistance \n profile for abcc10 using \n two hek 293 cell lines , which overexpressed abcc10 , and a vector - only \n transfected line . in this report , we \n use these previously described cell lines to assess if the alstolucines \n that inhibited abcc10 in atpase assays inhibited abcc10 in vitro . \n\nstandard cellular proliferation assays were performed to determine \n if the alstolucines were able to modulate abcc10 s in vitro \n resistance capabilities for the taxane paclitaxel . as shown in figure 4 , both alstolucines b ( 2 ) and f ( 3 ) modulated abcc10 s resistance to taxanes .\nalstolucines \n b ( 2 ) and f ( 3 ) completely reversed abcc10-mediated \n resistance to paclitaxel by resensitizing the transfectants to levels \n similar to the vector - only transfected line .\nalstolucines inhibit \n abcc10-mediated paclitaxel resistance : ( a ) \n alstolucine f ( 3 , red ) , ( b ) alstolucine b ( 2 , blue ) , and ( c ) akuammicine ( 1 , purple ) reverse abcc10-mediated \n paclitaxel resistance in two abcc10 transfectants ( , ) \n to levels of nontransfected control cell lines (  ) .\n( d ) alstolucine \n a ( 5 , orange ) does not reverse abcc10-mediated resistance . \n\nblack \n lines represent the survival of abcc10 overexpressing cell lines in \n the absence of inhibitor .\nwe \n have accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of novel \n pentacyclic strychnos alkaloids ( )-alstolucine \n b ( 2 ) , f ( 3 ) , and a ( 5 ) and n - demethylalstogucine ( 4 ) in an efficient manner , \n in addition to ( )-echitamidine ( 16 ) .\nwe have \n shown that abcc10 plays an important role in modulating taxane resistance \n both in vitro and in vivo .\nadditionally , overexpression of abcc10 \n confers 310-fold resistance to paclitaxel and 812-fold \n resistance to docetaxel .\nresults of in vitro and cell - based assays \n have identified alstolucine a ( 5 ) , alstolucine b ( 2 ) , and alstolucine f ( 3 ) , at 12.5 m , \n as potent inhibitors of abcc10 atpase activity .\nimportantly , these \n compounds do not inhibit the function of p - gp atpase activity , like \n current inhibitors of abcc10 .\nfurthermore , it was found that alstolucine \n b ( 2 ) and alstolucine f ( 3 ) at 10 m \n were able to resensitize the abcc10-transfected cell lines to paclitaxel \n when compared to vector - transfected control lines to levels comparable \n to or greater than that of cepharanthine , the most potent inhibitor \n found to date . altogether , these data \n justify the synthesis and evaluation of alstolucine analogs with increased \n potency and favorable physicochemical properties .\nall reactions containing water- or air -

drilling screws .\na drainage catheter was located just within the small gap at the edge of burr hole ( figure 1 ) .\nthe degree of the scalp depression was measured from the latest follow - up brain computed tomography ( ct ) using the infinitt pacs system ( infinitt healthcare co. ltd . ,\nthe depth of scalp depression was measured from this hypothetical scalp line to the deepest point of the depression . in each group\nlocal infections related with operation wound and further disseminated infections such as meningitis or osteomyelitis of skull were included , but infections unrelated with operation site such as pulmonary and urinary infections were excluded .\nwe also searched for occurrence of instrument failures such as screw loosening , displacement of bhc , implant protrusion , or scalp perforation in the worst case from the latest follow - up x - ray and brain ct in the bhc group . in order to evaluate any negative outcomes caused by burr hole defects from patient 's aspect\n, we conducted telephone surveys with the patients who demonstrated scalp depressions on the radiological images , and the respondents were asked to answer whether they had cosmetic inferiority complexes from scalp depressions or functional handicaps during activities of daily life such as hairdressing , combing , scratching scalp , or washing hair .\nall acquired data were accurately recorded , and statistical analyses were performed using statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) version 20.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . for comparison of gpo and bhc groups ,\na student t -

square test ( p<0.0001 ) .\nthe mean depth of scalp depressions was 2.451.38 mm in gpo group and 0.160.57 mm in bhc group , and the difference between two groups was statistically significant based on the result of student t - test ( p<0.0001 ) .\nthere were two cases of postoperative infections related with operation wound in the gpo group ; one was bacterial meningitis and another was local skin infection at operation wound .\nin contrast , there were no local or disseminated infections related with operation wound in the bhc group in spite of artificial instrumentations .\nhowever , these differences between the two groups did not have statistical significance ( p=0.498)(table 1 ) . any instrument failures such as screw loosening , displacement of bhc , implant protrusion , or scalp perforation\nwere not found from the latest follow - up skull x - ray , brain ct , and medical records in the bhc group .\ntelephone surveys were conducted on the 99 patients who demonstrated the scalp depressions on the radiological images .\ntotal 69 patients ( 69.7% ) responded to the survey , and the remaining 30 were excluded because they were out of contact , declined to comment , or died .\nseventy - three point nine percent of the respondents said that they had inferiority complexes about cosmetic outcomes from scalp depressions and 62.3% said that they experienced functional handicaps during activities of daily life . in gpo group ,\n49 ( 76.6% ) of 64 respondents had cosmetic inferiority complexes and 41 ( 64.1% ) experienced functional handicaps whereas , in bhc group , 2 ( 40.0% ) of 5 respondents had cosmetic inferiority complexes and 2 ( 40.0% ) experienced functional handicaps ( table 2 ) .\nit is well known that burr hole trephination is a simple and effective surgical option to treat patients with csdh and the rate of its surgical complication is very low.1,2,3,6 ) however , this small trephination leaves a focal bony defect which eventually causes an undesirable scalp depression .\nwhile many neurosurgeons are less concerned about the outcomes of such small scalp depressions , majority of patients experience cosmetic complexes and functional handicaps from these deformities as shown in this study .\nnumerous materials have been described to repair bony defects.6,14,15,17,23,24 ) these implants include organic substitutes such as autologous bone , muscle , or fat tissue , synthetic substitutes such as polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) , hydroxyapatite ( ha ) , or polyethylene , and metallic substitutes.23,28 ) organic substitutes are highly biocompatible , but related with donor site complications , time consuming , and difficult to apply .\npmma can be easily applied , but it is time consuming and has thermal reaction which is toxic to surrounding tissues .\nmineral graft such as ha is not toxic to the tissues and has osteoconductive properties , but it is too brittle and its resorption easily takes place when cerebrospinal fluid or water is present.9,13 ) polyethylene is biocompatible , available in various sizes , and easy and quick to apply .\nhowever , its poor cost - effectiveness can be a disadvantage.18,20 ) finally , titanium , one of metallic substitutes , has been used in orthopedic , plastic , and maxillofacial surgery in several decades as an alternative to autologous bone because of its good biocompatibility and lack of magnetic properties .\ncompared to other metals , it is nontoxic and compatible with surrounding tissues , has extremely low rate of corrosion , and elicits no inflammatory reactions.8,19 ) in addition to its excellent biocompatibility , bhc made of titanium is magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) compatible and does not produce significant artifacts on ct or mri.5,7,8,25 ) titanium bhc is commercially available in various sizes and shapes , easy to handle , and considerably less expensive than most other substitutes.16 ) ones used in this study have five screw holes around and they can be fixed in place using only two or three self - drilling screws in a minute .\ndifferent from other types of implants , these titanium bhcs have a small gap or opening at the edge that allows installation of a drainage catheter .\nthis unique feature makes titanium bhc more useful than any other alternatives because insertion of drainage catheter and reconstruction of burr hole defect can be achieved in a single session of operation ( figure 1 ) .\nour study clearly demonstrated much lower incidence of scalp depressions in the bhc group than gpo group .\nin fact , scalp depressions after reconstruction using titanium bhc was almost negligible in most cases ( figure 2 ) .\ntherefore , we suppose that gpo is insufficient to prevent scalp depression , and titanium bhc is highly effective in preventing scalp depression after burr hole trephination of csdh . according to the previous reports , the postoperative infection rate after burr hole trephination of csdh was 1.28 to 18%.10,11,21,22,26,27,29 ) in our study ,\ntherefore , we consider that application of titanium bhc at the drainage site does not influence the postoperative infection rates in csdh .\naccording to our 95 cases in bhc group , there were no instrument failures such as screw loosening , displacement of metallic materials , implant protrusion , or scalp perforation . in our opinion ,\nthe reasons for this result are that the skull is not a weight bearing system and the surrounding soft tissues are healed somewhat rapidly because all the instruments are placed beneath the pericranium .\nalthough it is possible to use five titanium screws for all screw holes , the use of only two or three screws is sufficient to construct a rigid structure ( figure 1 ) . according to our telephone surveys ,\n73.9% of respondents with scalp depressions had cosmetic inferiority complexes and 62.3% experienced functional handicaps during activities of daily life .\nbased on these results , we realized that patients were more concerned about the postoperative deformity than expected .\ntherefore , neurosurgeons should be aware of not only the neurological outcomes but also the cosmetic and functional outcomes caused by even minor burr hole defects .\nthe ideal implant should be biocompatible , strong enough to retain its physical shape , easy to handle , quick to apply , and cost - effective .\nfurther detailed studies on newer biodegradable materials with larger series of patients are required for advancement in techniques of cranial reconstruction after burr hole trephination of csdh .\ntitanium bhc is highly effective for reconstruction of skull defect after burr hole trephination of csdh .\nit provides excellent cosmetic and functional outcomes by preventing scalp depression from burr hole defect without significant complications such as postoperative infections or instrument failures .\nneurosurgeons must be aware of the undesirable cosmetic and functional outcomes caused by such minor cranial defects , and these deformities should be adequately repaired .","abstract":" objectivealthough burr hole trephination is a safe and effective surgical option to treat patients with chronic subdural hematoma ( csdh ) , it often results in a small but undesirable scalp depression from burr hole defect . \n this study is to evaluate the efficacy of titanium burr hole cover ( bhc ) for reconstruction of skull defects in these patients.methodsa hundred and ninety -

Among them 7 patients had died during the operation and 2 patients had died after discharge. We analyzed 91 patients with chronic subdural hematoma, including 53 male and 38 female patients with the mean age of 66.0 years (range, 26-86 years).\n\nThe inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1) Patients with csdh who underwent burr hole trephination; 2) Patients with csdh underwent trephination for clinical symptoms such as the sudden worsening of headache and mental disturbance, and improvement or disappearance of these symptoms after operation; and 3) Patients with csdh who underwent postoperative hematoma evacuation for clinical symptoms of headache and mental disturbance, and improvement or disappearance of these symptoms after surgery.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Patients with csdh who could not be treated by burr hole trephination; 2) Patients with csdh who were not suitable for burr hole trephination; and 3) Patients who underwent trephination for various reasons other than clinical symptoms.\n\nPostoperative hematoma formation was defined as hematoma that appeared with the onset of postoperative symptoms. There were no differences of outcome among the cases of postoperative hematoma formation at less than 5 days, 5 days to 7 days, or more than 7 days after operation. Therefore we categorized patients who had postoperative hematoma formation within 7 days after operation into one group. Patients with postoperative hematoma formation longer than 7 days after operation were considered as having late postoperative hematoma formation.\n\nThe size of postoperative hemat"}
{"article":"osteoarthritis ( oa ) of the knee is a major cause of disability that affects 12% of adults aged 60 years.1 knee oa is responsible for progressive joint pain and dysfunction due to articular cartilage and subchondral bone damage , synovitis , and osteophyte formation.2 conservative measures such as analgesics , aerobic training , and muscle strengthening are initially employed to alleviate symptoms and maintain joint function . in the estimated 3.6 million knee\noa patients who have unsuccessfully exhausted nonsurgical treatment options in the united states,3 surgical options such as total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty may be indicated .\nideally , alternative nonsurgical options that could decrease knee pain , restore joint function , and potentially delay the need for arthroplasty would be available to patients who have unsuccessfully attempted focused conservative therapies .\nintra - articular injection of hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , or viscosupplementation , is an efficacious nonsurgical therapy for treatment of knee oa.4 recent meta - analyses have confirmed the efficacy of viscosupplementation for knee oa over 6 months follow - up.57 accumulating evidence suggests that the clinical benefit of ha is underestimated using conventional meta - analytic techniques given disparities in control group effect sizes.8,9 intra - articular injection of exogenous ha replaces oa - induced reductions in the concentration and molecular weight of endogenous ha , thereby alleviating patient symptoms through postulated mechanisms including inhibition of chondrodegradative enzymes and inflammatory processes , stimulation of chondrocyte metabolism , and synthesis of articular cartilage matrix components.10,11 as chronic joint overload is a major risk factor for knee oa development,1214 treatment programs centered around viscosupplementation , but with concomitant utilization of joint -

for - performance initiatives , the ideal therapy for the patient with knee oa would be well accepted by patients , durably provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function , delay the need for tka , and yield an icer below that of typical willingness - to - pay thresholds . before participation in the multimodal knee oa\ntreatment program , all patients in the current study reported lack of functional improvement following > 3 months conservative therapy .\ntherefore , the study sample had entered into the  knee oa treatment gap,3 which represents a protracted period between conservative care failure and tka in which the patient experiences debilitating pain , reduced quality of life , and significant financial burden . in most patients ,\nthis period will persist for life because only 9%33% of patients are willing to undergo arthroplasty.4143 the economic burden of the treatment gap in knee oa is projected to reach 24 billion dollars by 2025.3,44,45 nonsurgical multimodal knee oa programs such as that reported in this study , which included once - weekly sodium hyaluronate intra - articular injections for 5 weeks , may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to address the treatment gap in knee oa . a novel aspect of this study was that clinical benefit and cost - effectiveness of this 8-week program administered in real - world settings were maintained over a mean 3.7-year period .\napproximately 70% of patients continued to meet the criteria for a womac responder , and the program was highly cost - effective with an icer of $ 6,000 per qaly in the base case and $ 7,634 per qaly in a monte carlo simulation with conservative parameters .\nto the authors knowledge , this is one of the longest follow - up periods of any study of a nonsurgical knee oa therapy .\nanother notable finding of this study was that only 22.8% of treated knees underwent tka during follow - up ( annualized tka rate=6.2% ) .\nfor comparison , other knee oa studies with minimum 2-year follow - up report annualized tka rates of 8.1%16.7%.4649 although the tka rates in this study are considerably lower than other studies , we can not directly infer that participation in this program reduces the need for tka .\nrandomized controlled trials with extended follow - up to assess health care utilization , including arthroplasty utilization , are required to draw firm conclusions on this topic . as payers expect medical interventions to not only be safe and effective , but also to provide sufficient value\n, there is an increasing focus on how these interventions perform not only in clinical trials , but in real - world settings .\nreal - world evidence from pragmatic studies is arguably more generalizable to the target patient population in comparison to clinical trials with stringent study entry criteria .\nresults from our base - case , sensitivity , and subgroup analyses suggest that , regardless of the assumptions made or the subgroup under study , the multimodal knee oa program was cost - effective in every scenario with a range of icers between $ 3,996 and $ 10,493 per qaly . given that this pragmatic research was performed in a real - world patient sample at 27 knee oa clinics across the united states within the context of usual care , the results reported here are directly translatable to clinical practice .\nthe primary strengths of this study were long - term follow - up in patients recruited from real - world knee oa practices across the united states , which confers excellent generalizability of these findings to the knee oa population .\nwe addressed this limitation by performing a number of sensitivity analyses that made optimistic , realistic , and pessimistic assumptions regarding outcomes in a hypothetical control group undergoing usual care .\nstill , the limitations and risks of bias inherent in case series remain , given the absence of a contemporaneous control group .\nsecond , only 54% of patients who we tried to contact were able to provide data for this study . while it is possible that data were not missing at random\n, there were no statistically significant differences in baseline patient characteristics comparing participants to nonparticipants .\nfinally , due to the nature of the study design that was largely dependent on patient recall , the only costs that were considered in this analysis were those related to the 8-week treatment program and to tka . while the cost of tka is the largest contributor to the economic burden of knee oa,50 the omission of additional cost drivers such as physician visits and imaging studies remains a limitation of the study .\nparticipation in a single 8-week knee oa treatment program , which included one cycle of five intra -

that is , a markedly raised vegf level ; the patient 's plasma and serum vegf levels were 555 pg \/ ml and 1530 pg \/ ml , respectively .\nit has been reported that a plasma vegf level of 200 pg \/ ml exhibits 95% specificity and 68% sensitivity for diagnosing poems syndrome 3 . according to the japanese diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome issued by the japan intractable diseases information center\n, a significantly elevated vegf level is defined as a serum level of > 1000 ng \/ ml 4 .\ntherefore , we were able to make a definitive diagnosis of poems syndrome in this rare case , which also involved synchronous breast cancer\na ncv study of the patient 's right side ncv , nerve conduction velocity . as a reference ,\n22 this test detected mixed neuropathy in the median motor nerve and ulnar motor nerve ( a long latency , low amplitude , and low ncv ) , and axonal neuropathy in the right ulnar sensory nerve ( a low ncv ) .\nthe ncv of the median sensory nerve , tibial motor nerve , peroneal motor nerve , and sural sensory nerve were unmeasurable . immediately after the final diagnosis ,\nthe patient began receiving chemotherapy based on a regimen for multiple myeloma ( 1.3 mg \/ m bortezomib , sc , on days 1 , 8 , 22 , and 29 of each cycle and 20 mg dexamethasone , po , on days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 29 , and 30 of each cycle ; each cycle lasted 6 weeks ) 5 as her condition was becoming increasingly lifethreatening .\nafter two courses of chemotherapy , the patient 's pleural effusion and ascites had almost disappeared , and her plasma and serum vegf levels fell significantly to 47 pg \/ ml and 266 pg \/ ml , respectively ; that is , below the diagnostic cutoff values of 200 pg \/ ml and 1000 pg \/ ml , respectively , indicating that these symptoms had been caused not by cancerous dissemination , but by poems syndrome . with the decreasing extravascular volume overload , her circulating plasma volume increased , leading to an improvement in her kidney function ( see table 2a ) , for example , her estimated glomerular filtration rate improved from 18 ml \/ min to 28 ml \/ min .\nthus , the patient 's condition had improved markedly , and she was well enough to undergo a radical operation for breast cancer under general anesthesia .\na histopathological examination of the resected specimens detected a 10  5 mmsized invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymph node involvement ( 0\/19 ) . when investigating the dissected axillary lymph nodes for poems syndrome ,\nnone of the following histopathological features of castleman 's disease were detected : hyaline vascular , plasmacytic , or mixed lymph node features .\n, adjuvant endocrine therapy ( 5 years ' tamoxifen treatment ) was considered sufficient . after receiving several more cycles of the same chemotherapy regimen ,\nthe patient is scheduled to receive an autologous stem cell transplant in the near future , which is expected to result in a substantial improvement in her neuropathy 7 \n 8 .\npoems syndrome was first reported by crow in 1956 9 and was subsequently described by fukase in 1969 10 .\nthe acronym poems was coined by bardwick in 1980 11 and stands for the five main features of the disease ; that is , polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , and skin changes .\nthe syndrome was also referred to as crow  fukase syndrome by nakanishi in 1984 based on a japanese study of 102 cases 12 , and this name is more widely known in japan than poems syndrome .\nalthough the pathophysiology of poems syndrome is poorly understood , the production of various inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukins ( il1 and il6 ) and vegf , by abnormal plasma cells is postulated to play a direct causal role in various symptoms of the condition 13 , 14 . in particular ,\nvegf levels exhibit the strongest correlations with disease activity in poems syndrome 3 , 15 .\nplasma and serum vegf levels of 200 pg \/ ml and 1,000 pg \/ ml , respectively , are considered to be diagnostic cutoff values for poems syndrome .\nelevated vegf levels are postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of enhanced vascular permeability , increased endoneurial pressure , and the deposition of plasma cellderived material 14 , 16 , 17 , which eventually cause a variety of symptoms , including extravascular volume overloading ( edema , pleural effusion , and\/or ascites ) , polyneuropathy ( demyelination ) , sclerotic bone lesions , and skin changes 18 , 19 .\nhowever , the mixed results seen with antivegf therapy indicate that vegf might not be the driver of the clinical manifestations of poems syndrome 20 .\nfurther studies of this issue are required . to the best of our knowledge ( based on a search of the pubmed database ) , this is the first case report about a case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer . using \npoems syndrome  and  synchronous cancer  as search keywords , we did not find any relevant articles ( accessed oct 19 , 2015 ) . at present\n, there is no evidence that certain types of cancer are strongly associated with poems syndrome .\nthus , it is likely that the current patient developed poems syndrome and breast cancer synchronously by chance .\nthe following three major factors might help to explain the diagnostic difficulties encountered in the present case .\nfirst , poems syndrome is a rare disease ; its prevalence rate was reported to be 0.3 per 100,000 in japan 17 . however , there is another fact that some patients with poems syndrome are first diagnosed at autopsy or go undiagnosed unless properly autopsied because of diagnostic challenges specific to the syndrome 21 , which makes the actual prevalence rate unclear .\nsecond , many of the signs and symptoms of poems syndrome mimic those of other disorders , leading to confusion and difficulties during the diagnostic process .\nespecially when being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer before the detection of preexisting poems syndrome , pleural effusion , ascites , lymphadenopathy , and bone lesions might be considered to be carcinomatous in origin .\nthe risk of such mistakes is probably higher in cases involving a metastasisprone cancer , for example , breast cancer .\nthird , clinicians have recently appeared to rely excessively on laboratory findings and\/or imaging studies during the diagnostic process .\nthe present case should act as a warning against this unfavorable trend and could yield a bitter but helpful lesson that ,  the more complex a disease is , the more important a physical examination tends to be  .","abstract":" key clinical messagepolyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin changes ( poems ) syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder that causes a paraneoplastic syndrome . \n we report the first case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer . \n the patient was at risk of being misdiagnosed with metastatic cancer , and it is important to emphasize that physical examinations provided vital diagnostic clues .

{"article":"\n papaver somniferum l. is known as opium poppy , which has been used as a medicinal remedy for its sedative , anesthetic , analgesic , and antidierrheal effects for thousands of years .\nthere are ancient documents mentioning about the medicinal properties of opium poppy such as the  de materia medica  written in a.c .\n65 by pedanius dioscorides . by the more recent studies , it is known that the medicinal properties of opium poppy come from its high concentration alkaloid content .\nmorphine , codeine , thebaine , papaverine , and noscapine are important and effective alkaloids in opium poppy for medicinal usage .\nbesides their medicinal properties , these alkaloids are highly addictive and thus they have forensic importance .\ntherefore , appropriate analysis of alkaloid content of opium poppy for screening and effective extraction is of great importance .\nfurthermore , the alkaloid contents present in opium poppy make it an asset for the researchers .\nso we hope these findings will be helpful and directive for us and\/or other scientists in the future research of papaver species .\nconventional extraction methods require more solvent , higher temperatures , and longer periods when high efficiency is desired . nowadays ,\nextraction techniques which can be applied in lower temperatures requiring less amount of solvent and time are looking for by the researcher . the ultrasonic extraction technique ( uae ) , using ultrasound waves disrupt open the cellular walls , accomplishes mass transfer successfully [ 4 , 5 ] . by efficiently accomplishing mass transfer , ultrasound assisted extraction proves itself to be an efficient way for extraction . when compared to another extraction techniques such as microwave and supercritical extraction uae is cheaper and simpler [ 5 , 6 ] . recently , uae has become a popular technique among most researchers who try to extract flavonoids , polysaccharides , polyphenols , and oil from different matrices [ 5 , 7 ] .\nhowever , not only the extraction method but also the other parameters such as preliminary preparations , particle size of the extracted material , solvent type , solvent concentration , and solvent \/ solid ratio , extraction temperature , extraction pressure , extraction time , and ph affect the extraction process . to obtain the optimal operating conditions for an extraction method\nis necessary for commercial applications of the process . in the literature , there are two optimization method in order to optimize the process .\none of them is one -

possible interactions among other operating parameters , this approach may result in misleading conclusions .\nin fact , the response of a process occurs by the interactions of different variables which affect the operation .\nresponse surface methodology ( rsm ) considers the probable interactions among operating parameters . in order to simplify this process and maximize utilization of data , design of experiments\n( doe ) approach can be used and then the response surface methodology ( rsm ) can be applied for the experimental results [ 5 , 8 ] .\nutilization of doe and rsm enables us to reduce the number of experiments needed and accurately estimate the optimal conditions from the experimental data . about the poppy straw : the various reported morphine extraction methods from poppy straw have been reported in the literature .\nthese reported methods include various steps involving water , organic solvent , and ph adjustments .\nthe simplest methods are the following ones covering the sonication : even these simplest methods contain some more purification and organic solvent stage . individual alkaloids ( morphine , codeine , papaverine , noscapine , thebaine , oripavine , reticuline , and narceine ) were quantitatively determined in the different samples by a validated capillary electrophoresis method .\ndepending on the plant structure , cultivar , and harvesting time , the composition of morphine is changeable . therefore , a common extraction procedure for all plant species can not exist and for poppy straw .\nparticle size of the extracted material , solvent type , solvent composition , the solvent \/ solid ratio , extraction temperature , extraction pressure , extraction time , and ph of the solvent are the parameters affecting the industrial processes which are applied for extraction . in order to optimize the process ,\nrsm is an aggregate of statistical and mathematical techniques used for developing , improving , and optimizing the processes [ 5 , 10 ] .\nsonication has been applied for the extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , pharmaceutically active compounds , and flavonoids from different matrices [

, and detection was carried out at 280  nm .\nthe method has been validated according to ich guidelines , taking into account the recommendations of other appropriate guidelines .\nresults obtained from testing different parameters during validation of the analytical method were given in table 1 .\nthe method recommended by the european pharmacopoeia for the quality assessment of the opium dry extract has been standardized ( ph . eur . 7.0 : 01\/2008  :  1839 ) .\nin addition to morphine , codeine , oripavine , thebaine , papaverine , and noscapine were analyzed by this method . despite the retention time of last noscapine peak\nthis is because the organic phase content of mobile phase increases with the analysis progresses .\nthen , concentration of mobile phase will return to the initial conditions after 20 minutes .\ncalibration curve was created to determine the concentration of morphine by comparing the peak areas with standard solutions which consist of morphine in the range of 100500  g \/ ml . morphine standard solution was prepared by dissolving its salt in purified water .\nmorphine , codeine , thebaine , and noscapine were analyzed and optimized in poppy capsules ; however optimization of other alkaloids were not included in this paper .\nthese designs require only three levels , coded as 1 , 0 , and + 1 .\nbox and behnken created this design by combining two - level factorial designs with incomplete block designs .\nthis procedure creates designs with desirable statistical properties , but , most importantly , with only a fraction of the experiments needed for a full three - level factorial .\nthese designs offer limited blocking options , except for the three - factor version . in this design , while two of the factors are constant at level 0 , the remaining factors are iterated within the levels + 1 and 1 ; then this process is repeated for different groups [ 14 , 15 ] . in this study ,\nbox - behnken design was performed with four parameters to explore the effect of them on the responses ( table 2 ) .\nthese were x1 ( solvent \/ solid ratio , ml\/500  mg ) , x2 ( ph ) , x3 ( time , min ) , and x4 ( temperature , c ) .\ndesign - expert 8.0.7.1 ( trial version ) software was used in order to apply the box - behnken design model .\ntwenty - nine experiments were performed with three replications at the center values to evaluate the pure error sum of squares .\nthe proposed quadratic model is shown as follows:(1)y=0+i=14ixi+i=14iixi2+i=14j = i+14ijxixj+e , where y is the response ,  \n 0 is the constant coefficient which is often described as intercept , x \n i ( i = 1  4 ) is the noncoded variable ,  \n i is the linear , and  \n ii is the quadratic , and ( i and j = 4 )  \n ij are the second order interaction coefficients [ 5 , 16 ] . statistical analysis on the means of triplicate experiments was performed out using the variance analysis ( anova ) procedure of the instat software version 3.0 .\nvariance analysis were applied to identify the interaction between the variables and the response using design - expert program .\nvariance analysis were applied for identifying the interaction between the variables and the response by using design - expert program .\nexperimental conditions of box - behnken design runs designed with design expert 8.0.7.1 are shown in table 3 .\ntable 3 also displays the effects of ph , solvent \/ solid ratio , time and temperature on the extraction efficiency obtained by uae .\nfigures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 display response surface plots for process variables .\nthe solvent \/ solid ratio is a crucial factor and was also studied to optimize extraction efficiency .\nlarge solvent volumes could make the procedure difficult and lead to unnecessary waste , while small volumes may lead to incomplete extraction .\na series of experiments were carried out with different solvent \/ solid ratios ( 10\/500 , 15\/500 , 20\/500  v \/ w ) to evaluate the effect of the solvent \/ solid ratio .\nthe increase of the yield with the increase of solvent quantity is consistent with mass transfer principles , since the concentration gradient which is driving force is supposed to be higher when a lower solvent to solid ratio is used , leading to higher diffusion .\nthe influence of the solvent ph on the extraction efficiency of morphine was examined over a range of 113 and the results are shown in table 3 .\nit can be clearly seen that extraction efficiency was the maximum at ph : 1 . when the solvent ph was increased from 1 to 7\nthen the extraction efficiency increased gradually , while the solvent ph was increased from 7 to 13 .\nthis might be explained by the fact that an acidic environment helps in the release of morphine into the solvent .\nthe influence of the time ultrasound on the extraction efficiency of morphine was examined over a range of 3060  min and the results are shown in table 3 .\nthey show that when the extraction time was increased from 30  min to 60  min , the extraction efficiency was low during the first 40  min of ultrasonication indicating that more time was needed for ultrasound to disrupt the cell walls and aid the release of morphine into the solvent .\nextractions of poppy straw were performed over temperatures ranging from 30 to 50c , since extraction at high temperatures is not economical .\nexpectedly , extraction efficiency of morphine increased steadily as a function of temperature until 45c , since mass transfer increase by temperature . but\nin general , extractions at higher temperatures increase mass transfer and extraction performance because of enhanced solute desorption from the active sites of plant matrix .\nindividual effects of process variables , which are also known as one - factor - at - at - ime approach , were applied in previous section .\nthis classical approach ignores the possible interactions of process variables with each other , which may result in misleading conclusions\ntable 2 shows the four parameters ( ph , solvent \/ solid ratio , time , and temperature ) including minimum , centre , and maximum points .\ntwenty - nine experiments were run and chosen randomly by the design expert software , and the responses were recorded ( table 3 ) . using response surface methodology owing to the software , a quadratic model applying not only forward stepwise but also backward elimination regressions for ey was obtained . using responce surface methodology from the software , a quadratic model given below was derived:(2)m=3.0002800.040567x10.172330x2  0.035744x3 + 0.038358x40.005500x1x2  0.000933x1x3 + 0.003200x1x4 \n0.001167x2x3 + 0.000708x2x4  + 0.000783x3x4 + 0.00104x12 + 0.021387x22  +

given for better explanation of new condition:(3)m=3.0002800.040567x10.172330x2  + 0.038358x40.005500x1x2 + 0.003200x1x4  + 0.021387x220.001713x42 . \n \nthe optimal extraction conditions were found by using optimization choice in design expert software to maximize the response .\nthis value was measured at 1.10 of ph , 60  min of extraction time , 42.36c of extraction temperature , and 19.99  ml to 500  mg solvent \/ solid ratio .\nthe maximum response was found as 3.38  mg morphine\/500  mg dried capsules under these operating conditions . after finding optimal conditions ,\nreal sample extraction experiments were repeated 6 times and then average with relative standard deviation was calculated . \nthe results of variance analysis were given in table 4 . in order to obtain the most suitable set of variables ,\nvariables are tested and evaluated within the given alpha levels ( 0.1 ) using both backward and forward techniques .\nbackward techniques cover all the variables to estimate parameters and then any variables with a nonsignificant parameter at alpha levels are removed from the equation .\nsimilar to backward technique , forward technique also evaluates the given variables within the given alpha levels . unlike backward technique\nthe significant variable with the highest value of standardized beta ( p < 0.05 ) will be added to the equation . then the next variable with the highest standardized beta value is assessed .\nvariance analysis for the quadratic equations of design expert 8.0.7.1 for the response were given in table 4 .\n( x1 ) , ( x2 ) , ( x4

Opium poppy also is being used for its psychoactive effects for humans. Since opium poppy has both a legal and a nonlegal use, it is often misused for its psychoactive effects (Chalise and Jha, 2009). The opium poppy genome has been studied in many species of Papaver. The opium poppy genome has been reported in the species Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) (Oryzae, 2001) and Papaver bracteatum (Oryzae, 2001).\n\nTo date, the first opium poppy genome has been reported in Papaver somniferum (opium poppy). It has been determined that the opium poppy genome consists of 14 chromosomes, which have a total length of 4.5Gb (Oryzae, 2001). The opium poppy genome has been sequenced by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in October 2013 (Dobrovolska-Kocisova and Whelan, 2013). The opium poppy genome is the most heavily annotated genome of its size ever reported. The genome of the opium poppy has been sequenced and was annotated in a draft assembly with an estimated completeness of 92% (Oryzae, 2001). The annotation of the opium poppy genome is based on the alignment of the draft opium poppy genome sequences to the papaver genome from Papaver somniferum (Oryzae, 2001). The Papaver somniferum genome was used in the alignment. It is known that the papaver genome is highly fragmented. To overcome the fragmentation of the Papaver somniferum genome, researchers first fragmented the Papaver somniferum genome into individual sequence fragments with lengths of 3\u201315Kb. These sequences were subsequently assembled into individual chromosomes, so the Papaver somniferum genome has been assembled into 13 chromosomes with a total length of 1.6Gb (Oryzae, 2001). For the Papaver somniferum genome, no scaffold sequences (chromosomal blocks that contain similar DNA sequences) were used. The assembly of the opium poppy genome has not been confirmed, but the 4.5Gb opium poppy genome is"}

{"article":"cardiac disease during pregnancy has been shown to be associated with maternal and neonatal complications in developed countries despite the advancement in medical care.15 these complications often translate to high maternal and fetal \/ perinatal morbidity and mortality especially in undeveloped countries.6 various studies have shown the incidence of cardiac disease during pregnancy to be 0.1%4.0%.710 the pregnancy - related physiological changes of increased blood volume , heart rate , and cardiac output  especially in the second half of pregnancy  coupled with the stress of labor and the hemodynamic changes of the puerperium may aggravate an underlying cardiac disease in an otherwise clinically stable woman.11,12 pregnant women with cardiac disease may go into either right- or left - sided heart failure , which may be precipitated or intensified by a lengthy list of extra cardiac factors including pregnancy itself.13 in developed countries , congenital heart disease ( chd ) is the most common cause of cardiac disease , accounting for 89%;14 whereas rheumatic heart disease ( rhd ) constitutes the major cause in developing countries.15 in sub - saharan africa , there is now a double burden of poverty - related cardiac disease ( eg , rhd ) and chronic noncommunicable diseases ( eg , hypertension).16 furthermore , there has been a four - fold rise in maternal mortality in south africa over the past decade due , in part , to their poor health care system ; heart disease has been found to account for 41% of the indirect causes of maternal deaths.17 data of these nature are lacking in our setting in nigeria .\nthis study , therefore , embarked on finding out the hospital - based incidence of heart failure during pregnancy and incriminated cardiac lesions , as well as maternal mortality and fetal \/ neonatal outcomes in a nigerian tertiary health facility .\nthe study was a descriptive , retrospective review of case notes of all booked and unbooked pregnant women who delivered at ladoke akintola university of technology teaching hospital ( lth ) , osogbo , southwest nigeria within the 7-year period of january 2004 to december 2010 .\nall of the women who presented with cardiac decompensation during pregnancy were selected and information on demographic data , new york heart association ( nyha ) class , investigations , treatment , and maternal and fetal \/ neonatal outcomes was then retrieved from their case notes .\ninvestigation results retrieved from the case notes included twelve - lead resting electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , chest x - ray with shielded abdomen in a few of the patients , electrolytes , urea and creatinine , urinalysis , full blood count , hemoglobin genotype , and blood culture in those with sepsis .\npatients with hypertension who were not in heart failure , diabetic patients , and those with preeclampsia or eclampsia were excluded .\nonly those with hypertensive heart disease were included , which included patients with hypertensive heart failure .\nstatistical analysis was performed with spss statistics 17 ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) .\nthe total number of obstetric cases during the 7-year period was 4523 ; of which , only ten reported cardiac decompensation , ie , an incidence of 2.2\/1000 .\ntable 1 shows the demographic and clinical data of the patients , the etiology of heart failure , and maternal mortality and fetal \/ neonatal outcome .\nseventy percent of the patients were aged 1824 years . the majority of the patients ( 80% ) presented in the second and third trimester .\nseventy percent of the patients had hypertensive heart failure with blood pressure ranging from 128\/90 to 180\/120 .\nthis was a case of pulmonary stenosis with sepsis syndrome , and the neonatal outcome was early perinatal death .\nthe two patients with hemoglobinopathy who presented with heart failure had a hemoglobin concentration of less than 4\nin addition to dyspnea as stated by the nyha classification of the patients , the patients had other symptoms and signs of heart failure such as cough , bilateral pitting pedal edema , elevated jugular venous pressure , s3 gallop rhythm , and tender hepatomegaly .\nbibasal crepitations were present in 80% of the patients , 10% had widespread crepitations in both lung fields with occasional rhonchi , and the remaining 10% ( the only case of pulmonary stenosis ) had bronchovesicular breath sounds without crepitations .\nall of the patients except one , who discharged herself against medical advice , had spontaneous vertex delivery within a few days of presentation at the hospital .\nthe results were as expected for patients with heart failure and the specific cardiac lesions shown in table 2 .\nthe pulmonary stenosis was severe , as demonstrated by a pressure gradient of 96 mmhg across the pulmonary valve .\nthe blood cultures of the patients with sepsis did not grow any organisms , which is not uncommon in the authors practice area as patients are likely to have been given antibiotics and other drugs before reporting to the hospital , hence empirical antibiotics were given .\nsome investigations were not carried out due to financial constraints or due to a very short duration of stay in the hospital before the patient died ( as retrieved from the case notes ) .\nother treatments were individualized based on the underlying cardiac lesion responsible for the heart failure .\nintravenous hydralazine and oral -methyldopa were given as appropriate to those in hypertensive heart failure to control their blood pressure .\ndigoxin was given to four of the patients with hypertensive heart failure who had poor systolic function on echocardiography .\nantibiotics and antimalarials were given to those who had clinical and objective laboratory evidence of infection and malaria , respectively .\nthe incidence of heart failure during pregnancy was 2.2\/1000 in this study . however , there is a lack of data on this subject , hence the reference to cardiac disease during pregnancy , in which incidences of 0.1%4.0% have been reported in other centers . in a study in sub - saharan africa ,\ndiao et al found that 72% of the pregnant women with heart disease presented with heart failure.18 it is also noteworthy that no cases of rhd as a cause of heart failure during pregnancy and only one case of chd , ie , pulmonary stenosis , were found in the current study .\nthis may be due to the fact that both rhd and chd are uncommon , as shown in a recently concluded 8-year prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 2501 patients presenting in one of the authors teaching hospitals , located in the same state as lth.19 the prevalence of rhd and chd was 3.1% and 2.1% , respectively.19 at the federal medical center , abeokuta , southwest nigeria , an echocardiography study by ogah et al reported 3.7% cases of rhd out of the 1441 subjects studied.20 even in the nigerian savannah , where sani et al reported a relatively higher prevalence of 9.8% from echocardiography screening about 5 years ago , the prevalence of rhd was still much lower than that of south africa.21 also , the majority of patients with rhd and chd die in their childhood or as adolescents and never reach the reproductive age group when they can present with cardiac disease during pregnancy .\nthe tertiary health care system lacks the appropriate facilities for open heart surgery to perform the needed corrections for these cardiac lesions , and treatment abroad is beyond the reach of most of these patients .\nrhd has been reported to be the most common cause of cardiac disease during pregnancy in resource poor countries.15 this is particularly so in south africa , with a high incidence of 36% reported for rhd in the heart of soweto study.16 nqayana et al reported rhd in 81% ( n = 77 ) of the 95 patients presenting with cardiac disease during pregnancy over a 1-year period at inkosi albert luthuli central hospital , durban , south africa.6 similarly , a 4-year audit of cardiac disease during pregnancy at pretoria academic hospital showed rhd as the etiology in 63.5% of the patients , while prosthetic valvular heart disease was 20.1% with also a possible etiology of rhd.11 there is now better control of communicable disease in nigeria as the health care delivery system is better equipped to tackle such problems .\nadvocacy as well as continuous and intense health education are being used to fight communicable disease in nigeria .\nfree health services are also being offered by most states and local governments across the country .\nall of these have resulted in a downward trend in the incidence \/ prevalence of cardiac diseases such as rhd and its underlying or associated infectious etiology . at lth ,\na grossly low prevalence of 0.002% and 0.004% for endomyocardial fibrosis in cardiac and medical patients , respectively , was recently reported compared to a prevalence of 10% that was obtained in the 1960s and 1970s in nigeria.22 endomyocardial fibrosis is another disease presumed to be indirectly linked with infectious agents .\nthe majority of the patients ( 70% ) in the current study were aged 1824 years , an age that is the entry point into the reproductive years , ie , when most women are likely to be carrying their first pregnancy .\nthis is in keeping with the reviews done in south africa where the majority ( over 50% ) of patients presenting were younger than 25 years.6,11 however , a canadian study reported the median age for presentation with cardiac disease during pregnancy to be 32 years.23 in another review of various studies pooled from 28 countries with over 60 hospitals , the median age was 30 years . the much lower age of presentation in africa may be due to the young age at marriage and early commencement of child bearing .\nthe first pregnancy is fraught with a lot of danger as this may unearth or aggravate an underlying medical or cardiac disease in an otherwise clinically stable nulliparous woman .\nfifty percent of the patients in the current study were primigravidae , which further confirms that the first pregnancy more often reveals the underlying cardiac condition .\nhowever , it is worth mentioning that two studies from south africa reported a higher incidence of 53% and 65.6% respectively.6,11 the three neonatal \/ perinatal deaths occurred in the babies of women aged 1824 years who were also primigravidae , ie , the same groups in which the two maternal deaths occurred .\nother factors contributing to these high neonatal and maternal mortalities were failure to register for antenatal care until the point of presentation with heart failure during pregnancy and lack of prepregnancy screening to identify these cohorts of patients with subclinical cardiac disease .\nall of the patients were unbooked , which is also in keeping with a study revealing that there were more occurrences of maternal and fetal \/ perinatal morbidity and mortality in the unbooked primigravidae.24 a 10-year review of maternal mortality in enugu , nigeria also reported that unbooked patients had a mortality rate 48 times higher than booked patients.25 it is also not unexpected that all of the patients presented between the second and third trimester as this period coincides with the period of a physiological increase in blood volume during pregnancy when cardiorespiratory adaptations occur ; in cardiac disease patients , there are increased symptoms and cardiac decompensation.26 all the maternal and neonatal deaths occurred in the second trimester at the onset of these physiological changes ; if medical care was sought earlier , there could have been a better prognosis .\nthe complication rate has been shown to be very low in pregnant women with pre - existing heart disease who received optimal antenatal care .\nmoreover , the superimposed sepsis in these two patients with hemoglobinopathy could also have caused secondary cardiomyopathy due to multiorgan failure .\nboth of them had severe anemia with hemoglobin concentration less than 5 g \/ dl .\npatients with an acute event associated with falling hemoglobin ( less than 5 g \/ dl ) can die suddenly from cardiovascular collapse.27 anemia can also cause high output heart failure .\nall of these conditions stated above would have culminated in the congestive cardiac failure with which these two patients presented .\npatients with hemoglobinopathy cope poorly with pregnancy for many reasons such as anemia , the different types of crisis associated with this disease , and the superimposed hemodynamic changes of pregnancy .\nthis is not uncommon as severe anemia during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of prematurity , spontaneous abortion , low birth weight , intrauterine growth retardation , and fetal death.27,28 hypertensive heart failure accounted for 70% of all the cases and six of the seven patients complied with their inhospital treatment and had favorable maternal and neonatal outcome , with one of them delivering twins .\nhowever , the seventh patient discharged herself against medical advice and was lost to follow - up .\nfive of the seven patients had left ventricular hypertrophy ( table 2 ) . heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy\nare recognized as the most typical cardiac complications of hypertension and feature prominently in the newly proposed clinical classification of hypertensive heart disease by the working group of the spanish society of cardiology.29 hypertensive heart disease has been defined as a constellation of abnormalities that includes left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic and diastolic dysfunction ; their clinical manifestations include arrhythmias and symptomatic heart failure.30 the prevalence of hypertension in nigeria continues to increase .\nits current prevalence in a semi - urban community in the same state ( osun state ) as lth is 36.6% ( using the seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention , detection , evaluation , and treatment of high blood pressure - based blood pressure threshold of 140\/90 mmhg ) or 13.3% ( using a blood pressure threshold of 160\/95 mmhg)31 compared to the previous crude national prevalence of 11.2% using the world health organization - based blood pressure threshold of 160\/95 mmhg.32 hence , a corresponding increase is expected not only in the prevalence of hypertension during pregnancy but also that of hypertensive heart failure .\ntwo of the patients presented with acute pulmonary edema and another two had proteinuria ; however , they all responded favorably to treatment and had good neonatal and maternal outcome . only one case of chd was seen in the current study .\nshe presented with rare pulmonary stenosis and right - sided heart failure and although she survived , she had a bad neonatal outcome ( early perinatal death )  delivering her baby within 2 days of admission .\nthis patient had severe pulmonary stenosis ( table 2 ) and needed percutaneous valvuloplasty to relieve the obstruction , but there is no facility for this in nigeria .\nthis procedure can be accommodated safely during pregnancy.33 all of the patients in the current study presented in nyha classes iii and iv in equal proportions .\nnyha iv is a very bad prognostic index , hence it is not surprising that all the maternal and neonatal deaths occurred in patients in this class . in a study in sub - saharan africa , maternal death\nwas significantly associated with nyha functional class iii or iv ( p = 0.001).18 heart disease during pregnancy accounts for a 100-fold higher maternal mortality compared with normal pregnancy in london , uk .\npoor fetal outcome correlates closely with nyha class,34 hence women with heart failure in a poor functional class should be encouraged to avoid pregnancy .\nrecently , the european registry on pregnancy and heart disease found that the majority of these patients go safely through pregnancy ; however , pregnancy outcomes were markedly worse in patients with cardiomyopathy and in developing countries.23 a limitation of this study is its retrospective nature , which did not allow for screening of all pregnant women for heart disease .\nhence , the cases of all those who presented with symptomatic heart failure for cardiac disease were reviewed .\na community - based prospective study is encouraged to screen pregnant women for cardiac disease in order to have a clearer epidemiologic picture of this disease during pregnancy .\nthis will serve as a baseline for planning towards the reduction \/ elimination of maternal mortality , which is one of the millennium development goals .\ndata from this hospital - based review shows that heart failure during pregnancy in nigeria is uncommon . however , there is a lack of data from other health facilities in nigeria .\nall the patients in this study were unbooked for antenatal care in the authors center .\nthe highest maternal and fetal \/ perinatal mortality occurred in primigravid women , which further emphasizes the importance of early booking for antenatal care as well as a complete cardiovascular evaluation during the first antenatal care visit .","abstract":"

The neural tube separates to the two hemispheres resulting in a bifid vertebral column. LPC is the cause of the most common non-familial midgut-deficiency disorder and also occurs more than three times as common as is familial cystic-craniosynostosis. These conditions have a high degree of overlap \u2013 as they result in a bifid skull and an intrauterine polyhydramnios. The skull is structurally malformed and can often cause a change in the overall shape and size of the skull, as well as significant distortion to the head circumference. LPC is a defect in the early developmental period and is the result of a failure of the vertebral column to develop. The vertebral body of the spinal column is made up of the vertebral body which consists of two different types of vertebral body. One is known as the neural arch and the other is known as the vertebral body. The spinal cord is a collection of nerves that carry impulses along from the brain to the rest of the body. It has two types of nerves \u2013 motor nerves and sensory nerves.\nTreatment\nThere are different techniques depending on the size of the opening and location of the opening. The size of the opening can affect the way of surgery. In order to close the opening, a skin flap is used. An open incision is made across the abdomen, starting at the umbilicus. The flap will extend from the patient\u2019s navel to the midline of the abdomen. The closure involves closure of the open flap and skin layers covering the skull and the head, followed by closing of the opening in the skull and suturing of the scalp to itself. In this technique, sutures are placed along the edges of the scalp that have been folded over from the inside. It involves skin closure, skin flap closure, and then reconstruction.\nThe most common cause of a lipomyelomeningocele is that the opening is located in the occipital bone. It is caused by a failure of the vertebral column to develop properly. Lipomembrane is the substance that is found on the surface of the vertebral body and is a precursor to fat.

infected macrophages , which exhibit \n a strong antiapoptotic phenotype .\nbirc6 also possesses e3 ubiquitin ligase activity \n that has been shown to ubiquitinate apoptotic proteins resulting in \n their proteosomal degradation .\nin addition to birc6 , \n we identified the protein defender against cell death ( dad1 ) , which \n has been implicated in downstream effects of bcl2 to prevent cell \n death .\nbecause the lcv also harbors eukaryotic \n pro - apoptotic proteins ( bcl2-associated athanogene 6 , apoptosis - inducing \n factor ) further investigation into the dynamics , balance , and functions \n of these antagonistic proteins could prove valuable to understand \n how l. pneumophila modulates a fine balance between \n pro- and antiapoptotic events in the infected cells . further investigation into the function and recruitment of antiapoptotic \n proteins on the lcv\ncould explain why permissive macrophages are particularly \n resistant to exogenous apoptotic stimuli during l. pneumophila infection .\nthe \n wt strain and ankb mutant lcv contains a significant \n portion ( 6% ) of proteins involved in post - translational modifications \n such as ubiquitination and farnesylation .\nit has been shown that multiple l. pneumophila effector proteins undergo host - mediated farnesylation , \n which enable their anchoring into host membranes .\nthere are no reports of l. pneumophila effector proteins undergoing ubiquitination . however , further characterization \n of the e3 ubiquitin ligases identified on the lcv could prove valuable \n to determine if they catalyze ubiquitination of l. pneumophila effector proteins through lysine or non - lysine - linked polyubiquitination .\nlysine - linked polyubiquitination of the lcv through \n the ankb effector is required for intracellular replication .\nprevious studies have shown the valosin - containing \n protein ( p97 ) participates in the removal of polyubiquitinated proteins \n from the lcv .\nproteome data identified \n the skp1 component of the scf1 e3 ubiquitin ligase complex on the \n lcv as well as rad23a and rad23b , which serve as multiubiquitin chain \n receptors that bind to the 26s proteasome and deliver lysine - linked polyubiquitintated proteins for protesomal degradation .\nfour e2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes ( ube2k , ube2n , ube2l3 , ubev1 ) \n were identified on the wt strain lcv ; however , only ube2k and possibly \n ube2l3 catalyze the synthesis of lysine - linked polyubiquitinated \n proteins .\ntherefore , it could be speculated \n that the e2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme ube2k or ube2l3 delivers \n ubiquitin moieties to the scf1 e3 ubiquitin ligase complex for lysine - linked polyubiquitination of the ankb substrates and rad23a \n or rad23b along with p97 delivers the polyubiquitinated proteins to \n the proteasome to generate an increase in free cellular amino acids .\nl. pneumophila is auxotrophic for seven amino \n acids ; therefore , retrieval of host cell amino acids is essential \n for intracellular replication .\nit is not known how l. pneumophila transports amino acids through the lcv membrane \n to provide the carbon and energy source for intracellular replication .\nwe have identified five amino acid transporters \n ( slc7a5 , slc3a2 , slc38a2 , slc1a5 , slc1a4 ) in the lcv proteome .\nit has been shown that the amino acid transporter \n slc1a5 is required for l. pneumophila replication \n in human macrophages .\nbecause of the \n essential need for the acquisition of host cell amino acids , further \n investigation into the localization and function of the host slc amino \n acid transporters and the specific amino acid transporter they import \n into the lcv lumen could provide insightful information on how intravacuolar l. pneumophila import amino acids from the host cell cytosol \n through the vacuolar membrane .\nalthough amino acids are the \n major sources of carbon and energy \n for l.pneumophila , the organism \n utilizes the entner \npneumophila mutants deficient in the entner  doudoroff pathway have a \n significant defect in intracellular growth in a549 human epithelial \n cells , a \/ j mouse macrophages , and acanthamoeba culbertstoni .\nthe presence of the glucose transporters \n ( slc2a1 , slc2a14 , slc2a3 ) on the lcv is consistent with the import \n and utilization of glucose by intravacuolar l. pneumophila as a potential source of carbon and energy during intravacuolar \n growth .\nthe lcv proteome contained two monocarboxylate \n transporters ( slc16a1 , \n slc16a3 ) that transport pyruvate across eukaryotic membranes .\ninterestingly , pyruvate supplementation rescues \n the ankb mutant for intracellular replication in \n human macrophages and amoeba .\ntherefore , \n host -

{"article":"t regulatory ( treg ) cells are a t lymphocyte subpopulation that control the balance between immune activation and tolerance .\ntreg cells can originate from two main sources : thymus - generated natural tregs ( ttreg ) and peripheral inducible tregs ( ptreg ) , generated during immune priming .\nseveral factors are required for ttreg generation ; these cells are strongly dependent on tcr and cd28 signals and on several cytokines .\ncytokines contribute to treg maintaining via  chain signaling of il-2 and il-15 , and tgf increases foxp3 expression . however , certain cytokines like as tnf- have a controversial role in ttreg generation [ 2 , 3 ] . on the other hand ,\nptreg generation requires stimulation in an anti - inflammatory milieu , a process where dendritic cells are critically involved [ 3 , 4 ] .\naccording to cytokine production , tregs have been further classified ; for instance , th3 cells are characterized by tgf production ; tr1 cells produce il-10 , and tr35 cells produce il-35 .\nwhile the expression of the transcription factor foxp3 can be transient in humans , this factor is associated with a suppressive function in mice .\nseveral action mechanisms by which treg cells control the immune response have been reported : ( 1 ) inhibition by immunoregulatory cytokines such as tgf , il-10 , and il-35 ; ( 2 ) inhibition by cytolysis of effector cell by producing granzyme and perforin ; ( 3 ) metabolic interruption , including an inhibition of the proliferative response via il-2 receptor , camp - mediated metabolic inhibition , and immunomodulation mediated by the a2 adenosine receptor ; ( 4 ) interaction with dendritic cells that modulates their function and maturation .\nil-10 is an 18-kd protein produced by tr1 cells . while its production is not restricted to this cell line since monocytes , dendritic cells , neutrophils , other t lymphocytes , and b lymphocytes are able to release it , tr1 cells are the only regulatory cells to produce il-10 [ 5 , 6 ] .\nil-10 has been described as the main immunomodulatory cytokine ; additionally , it can act as a paracrine or autocrine signal and can be induced by catecholamines [ 7 , 8 ] .\nil-10 inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines such as il-12 , causing a decrease in the th1 response and in inf- production ; it also promotes the phagocytic activity , increasing the removal of cellular debris at the inflammation site .\none of the best known molecular mechanisms of il-10 is the action on effector cells .\nthe costimulatory molecule cd28 is involved in the interaction between effector cells and antigen - presenting cells . by binding its receptor\n, il-10 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation in cd28 , inhibiting pi3k \/ akt activation , which in turn inhibits the signaling cascade leading to nf-b translocation ( figure 1 ) [ 10 , 11 ] . as shown in figure 1\n, il-10 exerts its biologic function by activating jak1 and tyk2 , both proteins associated to stat1 , stat3 , and in certain cases stat5 ( figure 1 ) [ 10 , 12 ] . in rats ,\nthe activation of the il-10 receptor in dendritic cells has been observed to promote the jak1-tyk2-stat3 pathway .\nwhen activated , this pathway inhibits dendritic cell maturation , decreasing the expression of mhc ii , cd11b \/ c , cd80 , and cd86 . in monocytes , il-10 has been demonstrated to induce the expression of the socs3 suppressor gene , which has influence on ifn - induced tyrosine phosphorylation in stat1 . on the other side , in a lps - induced inflammation model\n, il-4 has been observed to promote c - maf expression in activated macrophages ; c - maf binds the promoter of the il-10 gene , favoring its production ( figure 1 ) [ 14 , 15 ] . by binding its receptor in tr1\n, il-10 induces jak1 and tyk2 phosphorylation , activating stat3 , which is translocated to the nucleus , promoting socs3 ; in turn , socs3 inhibits the nf-b - induced factor myd88 , resulting in the inhibition of the il-1 , il-6 , and tnf- cytokines ( figure 1 ) .\nmoreover , it has been observed that il-10 promotes stat3 phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus in treg cells , mediating a further il-10 production ( figure 1 ) .\nil-10 exhibits a wide range of biological activities , including immunosuppression , anti - inflammation , and immunomodulation .\nil-10 is able to inhibit mhc i expression in b and t cells and also in dendritic cells , all of them involved in the inflammatory response .\nthe transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf ) family includes several structurally and functionally related proteins acting as multifunctional factors in a wide range of biological processes .\ntgf is a 25 kda protein and a multifunctional cytokine , given its different effects on the cell [ 18 , 19 ] . during secretion\n, tgf undergoes proteolysis by an endopeptidase , which cleaves the peptide bond linking the mature factor and the latency - associated peptide ( lap ) . for tgf to be activated\nthis process can be triggered by a number of factors , like temperature and ph changes .\nthree tgf isoforms are known in humans , 1 , 2 , and 3 , each coded in a different chromosome .\nfunctional tgf receptors are types i and ii ( tgf ri and tgf rii ) , and nonfunctional receptors include types iii , iv , and v. tgf ri and rii bind tgf-1 and tgf-3 with greater affinity than tgf-2 .\ntgf ri and tgf rii are responsible for the biological effects of tgf-1 in mammal cells . however , tgf riii is also capable of binding tgf-1 .\nwhile tgf riii has no role in signal transduction , it has been suggested that it controls the availability of tgf-1 in the local extracellular microenvironment and regulates its active presentation to the functional receptors [ 21 , 22 ] . in the extracellular space , tgf binds tgf riii , which then recruits tgf rii and phosphorylates itself ; alternatively , tgf can bind directly to membrane - anchored tgf rii and induce the attraction of tgf ri and its ensuing phosphorylation ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nboth tgf ri and tgf rii have a cysteine - rich extracellular region , a transmembrane region , and a cytoplasmic region ; the latter includes a serine - threonine kinase domain .\nthere is a functional dependence between tgf rii and tgf ri , since tgf ri requires tgf rii to bind the ligand , while tgf rii requires tgf ri for a functional signaling .\nwhen tgf binds tgf rii , the latter phosphorylates tgf ri in the serine- and glycine - rich domain near the transmembrane region .\nthe activation of the ligand - receptor complex allows the direct interaction of smad proteins with the kinase domain of the type - i receptor , recruiting smad2 and smad3 and phosphorylating them , thus activating the canonical pathway and forming a complex with smad4 .\nthis protein acts as a convergence node for the signaling pathways induced by members of the tgf superfamily ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nthe active complex formed by smad2 , smad3 , and smad4 is translocated to the nucleus , where it acts as transcriptional coactivator and regulates the transcription of several tgf-responder genes [ 21 , 23 ] .\ntgf activates tak-1 , a kinase of serine and threonine residues of the map kinase family , by the noncanonical pathway .\nras , a member of the small g proteins , has also been involved in signaling .\ncertain mapks , including those kinases regulated by extracellular signals such as erk-1 and erk-2 and stress - activated kinases such as jnk and pi3k , are also activated in some cell types ( figure 2(a ) ) .\na number of mechanisms have been proposed : ( i ) it suppresses effector t cell differentiation ; ( ii ) it promotes the differentiation of nave t cells into regulatory t or th17 cells ; ( iii ) it inhibits t and b cell proliferation ; ( iv ) it inhibits the activity of macrophages , dendritic cells , and nk . the inhibitory activity of tgf on treg cells is due to the high lap \/ tgf expression in treg membrane . unlike t cells , monocytes and dendritic cells express tgf receptors , thus allowing for cell - to - cell interaction .\ntgf has been demonstrated as necessary to generate tolerogenic dendritic cells ( dcs ) by inducing ido , an enzyme that inhibits t cell proliferation . as another relevant suppressive mechanism ,\ntgf inhibits the production of il-2 ( figure 2(b ) ) . the cis - actin protein , which suppresses il-2 production ,\nis called tob ; this protein binds smad2 , blocking the activation of runx 1\/3 .\ntgf modulates cell proliferation by controlling the expression of cell cycle - regulating factors , including cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) like p15 , p21 , and p27 and cell cycle promoters like cmyc , cyclin d2 , cdk2 , and cyclin e. tgf also promotes t nave cell differentiation into treg cells by inducing foxp3 expression , or into th17 cells in the presence of il-6 ( figure 2(c ) ) .\nfoxp3 then induces the transcription of inhibitory cytokines such as tgf ( figure 2(c ) ) . on the other hand , th17 differentiation from nave t cells\nsignaling via il-6 activates stat3 , which induces the expression of ror. ror then induces the transcription of il-17 ( figure 2(c ) ) .\ninterleukin 35 ( il-35 ) is a heterodimeric cytokine in the interleukin 12 ( il-12 ) family .\nthis cytokine family can be composed of one to five subunits ( p19 , p28 , p35 , p40 , and another from epstein - barr virus gene 3 , also called ebi3 ) .\nil-35 , an immunosuppressor cytokine formed by the p35 and ebi3 subunits , is produced by treg cells .\nil-35 has two known functions : to suppress the proliferation of t helper cells and to promote the conversion of nave t cells into highly suppressor treg cells ( itr35 ) .\nrecently , this cytokine was demonstrated to be capable of inducing the conversion of b lymphocytes into b regulatory cells .\nthe il-35 receptor is formed by the il-12r2 and gp130 subunits ; it can be heterodimeric or homodimeric .\nwhile gp130 is expressed in practically all cells , il-12r2 is expressed predominantly in activated t lymphocytes , nk cells , and to a lesser extent dcs and b cells .\nthe il-35 signaling path has not been completely described yet ; however , it is known that the heterodimeric receptor activates stat1 and stat4 , which induces ebi3 and p30 expression , causing nave t cells to convert into il-35-producing ( itreg ) cells , suppressing cell proliferation , blocking the shift to a th1 profile , and mediating il-10 production .\ntreg cells are able to release the immunomodulatory cytokines il-10 , tgf , and il-35 .\nthis action may target several immune cells expressing receptors for such cytokines . this way ,\nseveral immune cells in different stages ( activated , effector , or resting ) could be affected by the receptor - ligand interaction .\nthe effect of cytokines is probably not only local , since they could spread by the bloodstream throughout the body .\nthus , these cytokines play a role in the polarization of immune response during various pathologies .\nregulatory t ( tregs ) cells produce a serine protease called granzyme b , which allows them to induce apoptosis in effector t cells [ 2832 ] . during treg - effector cell interaction , directed exocytosis from treg granules to the extracellular space of both cells takes place ; these granules contain granzymes and perforins .\nonce released from the treg , perforin molecules insert themselves into the lipid membrane of the target cell and polymerize in the presence of calcium ions to form a transmembranal cylinder ; each cylinder forms a pore through which granzymes enter the cell ( figure 3(a ) ) .\ngranzyme can also enter the cell by an endocytosis process mediated by the manose-6-phosphate receptor . in this case\n, granzyme is sequestered in endosomes into the cytosol , and perforin acts to release it ( figure 3(b ) ) [ 3337 ] .\nadditionally , granzymes can bind to the cell surface in a way that granzyme recruitment is stimulated by perforin - mediated membrane damage ( figure 3(c ) ) .\nonce within the target cell , granzyme b could induce apoptosis by caspase - dependent or independent mechanisms , as discussed elsewhere [ 3840 ] .\ncytolysis allows treg cells to act on several immune cell populations by cell - to - cell interaction .\nthis mechanism is highly effective , since treg cells induce death by apoptosis on effector cells , thus decreasing the number of effector cells and controlling the immune response .\ninterleukin 2 ( il-2 ) , chiefly secreted by t cells in response to antigenic stimuli , is the main cytokine for t cell proliferation .\nil-2 receptor is expressed by t lymphocytes , nk cells , b cells , macrophages , and monocytes ; however , only t lymphocytes are capable of producing this cytokine .\nil-2 receptor is a complex formed by three subunits : alpha chain ( cd25 ) , beta chain ( cd122 ) , and gamma chain ( cd132 ) ; each subunit plays an important role in facilitating the transduction of il-2-dependent signals .\nalpha chain ( il-2r ) has a very short cytoplasmic domain and does not participate in signal transduction ; however , it is required to increase the affinity of il-2 to its receptor . on the other hand , beta ( il-2r ) and gamma ( il-2r ) chains play a crucial role in signal transduction .\ntreg cells constitutively express high levels of il-2 alpha chain , having thus a higher affinity to il-2 , and compete for this growth factor with proliferating cells . by depriving proliferating effector cells from il-2 , treg cells\ndo not only prevent them from continuing the proliferative process but also leave them without a vital cytokine , causing metabolic interruption and cell death ( figure 4(a ) ) [ 3 , 43 ] .\ncyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) is a second messenger , capable of regulating the functional activity of effector cells and antigen - presenting cells .\nthe high camp content in treg cells is due to the 50-fold higher expression of adenylyl cyclase 9 ( ac9 ) .\nadditionally , the high cd25 expression in treg cells has been observed to favor adenylyl cyclase 7 activation and camp accumulation .\nthe differential expression of cd25 and adenylyl cyclase in treg cells is controlled by foxp3 .\ntregs show a low camp degradation rate due to a diminished expression of the phosphodiesterase 3b enzyme in this cell subpopulation .\nrecent findings indicate that camp concentration is controlled by mir-142 - 3p , a microrna that regulates foxp3 transcription activity , and thus the expression of adenylyl cyclase .\nwhile mir-142 - 3p inhibits the production of adenylyl cyclase 9 in conventional t cells , this effect is not seen in treg cells since the foxp3 transcription factor negatively regulates mir-142 - 3p expression and keeps the ac9\/camp pathway active .\ntreg cells transfer camp to target cells by intercellular communications called gap junctions ( figure 4(b ) ) . in mammal cells ,\ncommunicating junctions are used for the bidirectional traffic of ions , metabolites , and other molecules weighing less than 1  kd .\nthe increase in intracellular camp activates protein kinase a ( pka ) , since camp binds to the pka regulating subunit , activating it by releasing its catalytic subunit .\non the cell membrane inner face , phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase c - src ( csk ) by pka increases its activity ; then , csk phosphorylates and inactivates the lymphocyte - specific protein tyrosine kinase ( lck ) , an important protein in the proximal activation of t cell receptors . a number of signaling pathways can be regulated by pak .\nfor instance , the camp response element - binding ( creb ) protein is phosphorylated by pak at serine 1343 , which prevents it from forming a complex with the csk binding protein ( cbp ) and from binding to camp response elements ( cre ) ; these can be found in genes coding for t cell receptors or in other genes involved in t cell activation .\nadditionally , pak regulates the activity of the nuclear factor in activated t cells ( nf - at ) .\nwhen nf - at is phosphorylated by pak , binding sites for another protein called 14 - 3 - 3 are created .\nthis new complex decreases nf - at transcription activity ( figure 4(b ) ) [ 4749 ] . when cells are in resting state , nf-b is found in the cytoplasm , complexed with its inhibitor , ib , which prevents it from translocating to the nucleus . during cell activation ,\nib is phosphorylated by an ib kinase , which induces the nf-b \/ ib complex to split apart .\nconversely , when pka is phosphorylated , its catalytic subunit ( pka - c ) binds to the nf-b \/ ib complex , stabilizing it and keeping it inactive ( figure 4(b ) ) .\nnf-b regulates the transcription of a large number of genes , including those coding for the proinflammatory cytokines tnf- il-1b , il-6 , il-8 , vegf , and metalloproteases ( mmp1 , mmp2 , mmp3 , and mmp13 ) . while the main target for camp is pak , camp has also been demonstrated to directly activate the exchange protein directly activated by camp ( epac1 and epac2 ) .\nthis protein regulates the activation of a gtpase called rap-1 , responsible for activating erk , thus inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation ( figure 4(b ) ) .\ncd39 and cd73 are ectoenzymes , highly expressed on the surface of treg cells ( figure 4(c ) ) .\ncd39 is a nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 ( ntpdase 1 ) that degrades atp into amp .\nthe expression of cd39 in tregs is regulated by the foxp3 transcription factor , and its catalytic activity is enhanced by tcr compromise . in turn ,\nextracellular amp is rapidly degraded into adenosine by cd73 , an ecto-5-nucleotidase bonded to the membrane of treg cells ( figure 4(c ) ) .\nthe adenosine resulting from amp hydrolysis binds four different surface receptor subtypes coupled to gs proteins , called a1 , a2a , a2b , and a3 .\nthe a2ar receptor is the main adenosine receptor associated to t and b lymphocytes , nk cells , macrophages , dendritic cells , and granulocytes ( figure 4(c ) ) .\nthe outcome of stimulating these receptors is an intracellular amp accumulation ; through the camp - dependent protein kinase , these signals phosphorylate and activate creb . the latter binds the nuclear cofactor p300 , producing a complex that regulates the expression of several genes in their promoter regions .\ncreb is able to regulate indirectly the transcription of some inflammatory genes , competing with nf-b \/ p65 and then suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like tnf- ( figure 4(c ) ) [ 51 , 5355 ] .\namp can also activate other substrates like epac1 and other kinases such as erk and jnk , altering the expression of proinflammatory genes through transcription factors responsible for synthesizing interleukins like il-12 and tnf- ; it promotes as well the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines like il-10 ( figure 4(c ) ) .\nthe fact that tregs produce adenosine and respond to it at the same time means that this molecule acts as an autocrine factor to optimize the anti - inflammatory response .\nit also increases treg suppressor capacity , inhibits the expression of costimulatory molecules in dendritic cells , and inhibits the activation of effector cells [ 52 , 55 ] .\ntreg - mediated metabolic disruption occurs by competition for il-2 , a growth factor for effector cells . under these conditions ,\ntreg cells control the immune response in a nonspecific but effective manner , since by consuming il-2 treg cells inhibit effector cell proliferation , actually impairing the immune response . on the other hand , immunosuppression mediated by camp and the 2a adenosine receptor\ninduce several signaling pathways in effector cells that in turn impact transcription factors , controlling the effector response .\nthis molecule has a high affinity by dendritic cell - expressed cd80 and cd86 ; thus , tregs compete with effector cells to bind these ligands .\nthis interaction involves several events , including the production of inf- , a potent inducer of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( ido ) .\nido degrades tryptophan in a metabolic pathway starting with tryptophan oxidation to n - formylkynurenine , immediately followed by hydrolysis to kynurenine .\nthis initial product follows various degradation pathways whose final products are kynurenic acid , 3-hydroxykynurenine , anthranilic acid , 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid , and quinolinate ( figure 5(a ) ) [ 5961 ] .\nonce tryptophan is degraded by ido , a signaling cascade starts . since there is a local tryptophan deficit , the level of transfer rna without amino acid load increases , and as a result the general control nonderepressible kinase 2 ( gcn2 ) is activated , and it hyperphosphorylates the translation initiation factor ( eif2 ) , leading to a suppression in protein synthesis .\nthe union of the ternary complex formed by eif2 , gtp , and the initiation transfer rna for methionine ( met - rnai ) to the 40s ribosome subunit is inhibited , preventing the release of the binary complex eif2\/gtp and inhibiting the eif2-promoted gtp \/ gdp exchange .\nthe result is a cell cycle arrest in the g1 phase and thus anergy of effector t cells ( figure 5(a ) ) [ 60 , 62 , 63 ] .\nalthough the mechanism is not well understood , 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and quinolinic acid have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in th1 cells by directly activating caspase-8 [ 64 , 65 ] ; this truncates the bid protein , producing a small proapoptotic fragment called truncated bid ( tbid ) .\nthis active fragment can translocate to the mitochondria , causing the release of cyt c by interaction with bax , another member of bcl-2 family . in the cytosol ,\ncyt c interacts with the proteins apaf1 and caspase-9 in the presence of atp , building the apoptosome , a catalytic complex that starts the caspase cascade activation , leading to the digestion of structural proteins , degradation of chromosomal dna , and phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies ( figure 5(a ) ) [ 66 , 67 ] .\nthe metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid has also been reported to induce death in activated t cells by depleting glutathione , one of the main antioxidant molecules in animal cells .\na decrease in glutathione promotes a misbalance between ros production and the antioxidant capacity . on the other side , t cell apoptosis due to oxygen free radicals produced by kynurenine and\n3-hydroxykynurenine has been observed , leading as well to changes in the oxidant - antioxidant balance and promoting oxidative stress .\noxidative stress causes a global collapse of mitochondrial function , reducing energy production and therefore contributing to cell death [ 64 , 69 ] .\nanother immunosuppression mechanism involves kynurenine binding to the aryl - hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) , a transcription factor expressed in cell populations like t cells , resulting in a shift to a t regulatory cell phenotype ( figure 5(a ) ) [ 70 , 71 ] .\nlymphocyte - activation gene 3 ( lag3 , cd223 ) is a cell surface molecule expressed in tregs .\nstructurally , lag3 is homologue to the cd4 receptor and binds to mhc ii with a significantly higher affinity than cd4 [ 7375 ] .\nthe lag3-mhc ii union induces a signaling cascade starting with plc2 and p72syk phosphorylation and the activation of pi3k \/ akt , p42\/44erk , and p38mapk ( figure 5(b ) ) .\nthe latter kinase has been involved in the maturation process of dendritic cells ; these exhibit an increase in the expression of costimulatory molecules and a decrease in antigen capture [ 76 , 77 ] .\nanother study demonstrated that , after crosslinking mhc in the presence of lag3 , itam - mediated inhibitory signals are induced , involving erk sequential activation and ship-1 recruitment similar to those proposed for fcr. the inhibitory signaling started by coengagement of mhc with lag3 along with cd4 and tcr could be mediated by several components , including ship-1 , which may not be recruited by themselves by the cd4 or tcr signaling pathways .\nship-1 has been labeled as a nf-b negative regulator and as a negative factor in cell activation .\nadditionally , the conjoint union of ctla-4 and lag3 promotes a tolerogenic phenotype in dcs ( figure 5(b ) ) .\ndendritic cells being a key component of the immune response , the action implying cell - to - cell contact with dcs is one of the most important mechanisms for treg cells . depending on its phenotype ,\nwhen interacting with a treg cell , a dc acquires a tolerogenic phenotype , which in turn promotes further treg cell generation , providing a suppressor microenvironment .\nthe competition for dc ligands between effector and treg cells allows for an additional control mechanism of the immune response .\nthe action mechanisms of tregs described above can act together or independently , according to the requirements of the immune system and homeostasis maintenance , or during the progression of various pathological processes .\ntreg cells have been used as part of an escape mechanism by several pathogens , including viruses   and helminthes , and they also modulate the immune response in noninfectious pathologies such as tumors . knowing the modulation molecular mechanisms and their effect according the pathological situation could help in identifying the therapeutic targets allowing an effective immune response .","abstract":" t regulatory cells play a key role in the control of the immune response , both in health and during illness . \n while the mechanisms through which t regulatory cells exert their function have been extensively described , their molecular effects on effector cells have received little attention . \n thus , this revision is aimed at summarizing our current knowledge on those regulation mechanisms on the target cells from a molecular perspective .

{"article":"vascular injury is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of spine surgery . throughout its course\n, the aorta remains in close proximity to the thoracic and lumbar spine and is at risk from malpositioned pedicle screws or other hardware.1 despite this risk , the reported rate of vascular injury from spine surgery is low . in one systematic review ,\npapadoulas et al found the incidence of vascular injury after excision of a herniated lumbar disc via a posterior approach to be less than 0.05%.2 in addition , hicks et al systematically reviewed 14,570 pedicle screws placed in the thoracic and lumbar spine of 1,666 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( ais ) ; they found a 4.2% overall rate of screw malposition with 6 of 8,147 screws ( 0.07% ) abutting the aorta in the subgroup of studies that reported this finding .\nthere were no reports of major vascular complications.3 \n  despite the low rates of vascular injury identified in these reviews , the literature contains multiple case reports in which pedicle screw instrumentation was associated with early or late aortic injuries.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 in the majority of these reports , treatment consisted of removing of the offending hardware with simultaneous open or endovascular aortic repair ( evar ) . here\n, we describe the case of an adolescent patient with a malpositioned pedicle screw abutting the thoracic aorta and new complaints of deep - seated thoracic pain .\nintraoperative aortography demonstrated normal flow in the thoracic aorta , so no graft was placed to avoid the known morbidity of evar .\nthe patient was a 20-year - old man who presented to clinic with 4 months of back pain . at the age of 15 years , he had undergone a t6t8 posterior instrumented fusion with excision of an osteoblastoma from the right t7 pedicle and lamina . at that time , his primary symptom was midthoracic pain ; this pain resolved within 3 months of his index surgery .\nwhen he returned to clinic 5 years later , he complained of deep - seated substernal and midthoracic pain .\n, the patient had a well - healed midline incision with no signs of infection .\nhe had normal strength , sensation , and reflexes in his bilateral upper and lower extremities .\nposteroanterior and lateral radiographs ( fig . 1 ) and a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan of the thoracic spine ( fig .\n2 ) demonstrated that the left t6 screw penetrated the lateral cortex of the t6 pedicle and abutted the posteromedial aspect of the aortic wall .\nthere was no pseudoaneurysm or periaortic inflammation identified to suggest frank penetration into the aortic lumen .\nhowever , it was felt that because of ongoing mechanical irritation by the abutting screw and the patient 's new pain symptoms , there was an increased risk of aortic perforation , dissection , or thrombotic complication if the screw were left in place , and that therefore , it was advisable to remove it . \n\nposteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic spine show lateral positioning of the left t6 pedicle screw . \n\nan axial computed tomographic scan slice through the t6 pedicle and sagittal reconstruction show the left t6 pedicle screw breaches the lateral cortex and impinges against the posteromedial aorta .\nafter a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient , his family , and the vascular surgery service , the patient elected to go to the operative theater with plans to obtain endovascular control of the aorta , remove the offending hardware , and stent the aorta if required . in the theater ,\ngeneral anesthesia was induced and a double - lumen endotracheal tube was placed in case open thoracotomy were required .\nthe patient was positioned supine and 7-french sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery .\na catheter was passed via this sheath into the thoracic aorta and an aortogram was performed to confirm appropriate position of the catheter and adequate visualization of the aorta . no evidence of stenosis , contrast extravasation , or intraluminal material was noted . with the right groin catheter in place ,\nthe previous midline thoracic incision was reopened and dissection was carried down to the level of the posterior instrumentation .\nthe soft tissues were cleared from around the screws and the end caps removed . once the vascular surgery team indicated their readiness to proceed , the left t6 screw was backed out .\nthe vascular team then performed a second aortogram , which again demonstrated no extravasation of contrast or other abnormal finding .\na final aortogram after removal of all hardware showed no evidence of injury or abnormal flow within the thoracic aorta ( fig .\n3 ) . given the normal aortogram , it was decided no graft placement or further endovascular intervention was necessary . \n\nintraoperative aortography demonstrates no extravasation of contrast and normal filling of the descending thoracic aorta .\nthe posterior wound was thoroughly irrigated and closed in layered fashion and the patient was returned to the supine position .\nestimated blood loss for the procedure was 200 ml . the patient was awakened and found to be neurologically and vascularly intact , unchanged from his preoperative examination .\nhe was admitted to the surgical floor where he progressed appropriately and was discharged home on postoperative day 2 .\nvascular injury has been recognized as a rare potential complication during anterior spine procedures , with a rate of less than 5% reported in a recent systematic review.11 after posteriorly based procedures , reported rates of acute vessel injury in systematic reviews range from 0 to 0.05%.2 \n 3 however , because of the intimate association of the aorta with the thoracic and lumbar spine , it remains at risk of acute or delayed injury from misplaced posterior instrumentation.1 a growing number of reports suggest such injuries are likely an underappreciated complication.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n  in cases of frank perforation of the aorta or another major vessel , immediate operative or endovascular intervention is indicated to repair the injury .\npotential risks of impinging instrumentation include late catastrophic hemorrhage , pseudoaneurysm formation , or thromboembolic complications .\nthe best evidence in favor of observing impinging hardware without intervening comes from foxx et al who retrospectively reviewed the position of 680 pedicle screws in 107 patients on routine postoperative imaging .\nof the 680 screws , 33 screws ( 4.9% ) were found to contact a major vessel on imaging , including the aorta in four cases .\neight of the nine affected patients were living and asymptomatic at average follow - up of 25 months , with one patient deceased from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at 16 months after surgery.12 from these data , the authors concluded that asymptomatic , impinging screws may be safely observed with serial imaging .\nevidence in favor of hardware removal comes primarily from case reports in which pedicle screws impinging against the aorta were diagnosed on a delayed basis and successfully managed with hardware removal and evar.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 10 exact details of the procedures varied , but in all cases patients had endovascular stent grafts placed that bridged the affected region of the aorta before or after removal of their hardware .\nno complications were reported.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 10 \n  of note , in several of these reports , patients experienced a symptom - free period after their initial spine surgery and were diagnosed with impinging hardware after returning 4 months to 6 years later with new complaints of pain in the instrumented region ; these complaints resolved after screw removal.6 \n 8 \n 10 we hypothesize that in the setting of impinging hardware , new - onset pain after a symptom - free period may potentially represent a  red - flag  for surgical intervention .\nin an in vivo bovine model in which thoracic pedicle screws were left abutting the aorta , faro et al found histopathologic changes in 96% of aortic specimens at 3 , 6 , and 12 months .\nmore than half of the specimens showed significant wall thinning , and in aggregate , the impinged aortas demonstrated decreased stress to failure compared with controls .\nthe severity of tissue damage on histology did not correlate with the depth of impingement on ct scans.13 in the context of the limited clinical data , this study raises concerns that screw impingement may compromise of vessel wall integrity even in the absence of frank perforation .\nthe case considered here is unique in that our patient was much younger than those in previous reports ( 20 years old vs. older than 60 years ) and because he was successfully managed without endovascular grafting given his benign findings on intraoperative aortography .\nas the incidence of pedicle screw instrumentation for ais continues to rise , one expects to see younger patients facing decisions about how to manage impinging hardware.3 on the basis of multiple case reports , placement of an endovascular aortic graft appears to represent an effective , low - morbidity treatment for impinging or perforating pedicle screws in older population .\nhowever , available clinical data after evar in the vascular literature suggest a significant incidence of complication and reoperation at intermediate to long - term follow - up that would be more relevant to a younger patient . in one series of 1,066 patients treated with evar for abdominal aortic aneurysm and followed up between 2 and 16 years , 233 patients ( 22% ) required repeat operation , with 131 operations attributed to graft - related complications ( 12% ) , and the remainder to progression of vascular disease.14 in another study using a modern endovascular aortic graft exclusively ( endurant ; medtronic , minneapolis , minnesota , united states ) , 16 of 100 grafts showed leakage on ct angiography and 5 of 100 patients required endovascular or operative reintervention within the first year.15 \n  the high rate of complications and reoperation associated with evar is sobering , particularly when considering application in an adolescent patient . here\n, we describe the safe and successful removal of a pedicle screw impinging on the aorta in a symptomatic 20-year - old patient . on the basis of normal intraoperative aortography\n, we elected against placement of endovascular graft given the high incidence of associated complications and the expected longevity requirement in a young patient . at more than 2 years after the procedure\nwe would recommend considering similar treatment of other young patients when intraoperative aortography shows no abnormality .\n\n neuroscience clinical institute , epworth hospital , melbourne , victoria , australia potter et al are to be commended for presenting an important yet very uncommon surgical complication of a misplaced thoracic screw requiring revision for aortic impingement.1 the index procedure was an excision of a t7 osteoblastoma 5 years previously .\nthe presentation of the now 20-year -

term fate of the stent graft in young patients .\nthe post - discovery decision - making described here by the authors and the commenter is very helpful for all of us clinicians .\nthis is a classic scenario for which there is no  evidence base  as we have no control group ; we have to use our judgment , experience , and the few descriptions offered in the peer - reviewed literature , even if its level of evidence is 4 or 5 .\nthis case raises the bigger question : should all patients have some form of routine post - instrumentation advanced imaging to check on segmental hardware placement even in asymptomatic patients ? what do you think ?","abstract":" \n study design   case report and review of the literature . \n \n objective  the objective of the article is to report the case of a 20-year -

We describe an extremely rare complication of pedicle screw fixation of the spine that can occur after posterior fusion. this problem has been termed \u201cpostfusion syndrome\u201d and typically occurs within a month of surgery.\nmost pedicle screws used today are a single-stage construct, but a few can be implanted in a manner that allows for a second stage. these include the pedicle nail (carlstroem) and the croma screw (schulte).\nwe present the case of a patient undergoing posterior spinal fusion using four pedicle screws. 28 days after surgery the patient returned to the hospital after a motor vehicle accident with right shoulder pain. the patient was diagnosed with a complete traumatic bilateral brachial plexus injury and had revision of a pedicle-screw implant for a fractured right radius. the next morning, the patient underwent right upper extremity revascularization because of the brachial plexus injury. at the completion of the procedure a retrograde arterial wire embolization was performed.\nthe arterial wire passed into the descending aorta, causing the immediate development of a 2.5-cm pseudoaneurysm of the aorta. the next day the right upper extremity revascularization surgery was aborted when there was evidence of an aortic"}

In this blog, we will take a look at some of the common causes of cervical radiculopathy that are commonly seen in the emergency room.\nIn This Article\nIntroduction\nThe cervical spine is made up of seven vertebrae. The first two, the atlas and axis, make up the cervical spine. The cervical spine contains a special nerve called the spinal nerve, which relays signals from the brain to the body.\nCervical radiculopathy is a condition characterized by pain, numbness, or weakness in the arm or hand as a result of a pinched nerve or injured cervical spine.\nThe most common causes of cervical radiculopathy are:\n- Cervical spondylosis\n- Cervical disc degeneration\n- Cervical herniation\n- Cervical disc injury\n- Cervical nerve compression\n- Cervical spondylitis\n- Infection\n- Cervical stenosis\nCervical radiculopathy can be caused by a number of conditions, such as cervical spondylosis, cervical disc degeneration, cervical herniation, cervical disc injury, cervical nerve compression, and cervical stenosis. Cervical radiculopathy can also be caused by infection, cervical spondylitis, or cervical stenosis. Cervical radiculopathy is the most common cause of arm pain that is referred from the cervical spine to the arm. It is also a common cause of neck pain that is referred to the shoulder or elbow. The pain is most often described as burning or sharp in nature and can be associated with tingling or weakness in the hand and arm.\nWhat are the symptoms of Cervical Radiculopathy?\nCervical radiculopathy is a condition that causes pain and tingling in the arms or legs. The pain and tingling are most commonly felt in the neck and shoulder, but can also spread to the hands and arms. Cervical radiculopathy can be caused by a number of things, including spinal stenosis, disc herniation, and cervical radiculopathy.\nCauses\nThe causes of cervical radiculopathy are many. It can be caused by compression of the nerve root or a disc herniation. Cervical radiculopathy can also be caused by compression of the nerve root by a bone spur or other condition. The pain can radiate down the arm and"}

{"article":"the national cervical cancer coalition ( nccc ) estimates that worldwide , 473,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and 253,500 patients die of this disease annually .\nthis makes cervical cancer the twelfth most common cancer and the fifth cause of cancer - related deaths in the world .\nhuman papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection is the most important risk factor for the development of cervical cancer .\ntreatment of cervical cancer consists of surgery at the early stages and chemotherapy and radiation therapy for advanced disease .  \nif diagnosed early , the 5-year survival rate of the patient is more than 90% .\ntherefore , early detection is currently the most effective means to improve survival of patients .\nthe papanicolaou ( pap smear screening ) test followed by colposcopy is the most frequently used means to detect precancerous and cancerous changes in the cervix .\nhowever , the current most practical pap smear screening plus cytology test has a low sensitivity , especially in discriminating high - grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( hsils ) from other abnormalities and normal tissues . in routine clinical practice ,\nthus , development of a more sensitive and specific method to detect cervical cancer early and accurately is urgently needed .   for several past decades , we have witnessed the rapid development and use of optical methods to investigate changes in cell behaviors ( such as migration and intracellular protein movement ) and for disease diagnosis ; optical techniques enable the detection of changes in biochemical and morphological features that are concurrent with precancerous conditions .\nthe advantage of optical techniques is that in living cells visible light does no harm or is relatively benign .\noptical techniques such as confocal reflectance microscopy , optical coherence tomography , light - scattering spectroscopy , and elastic scattering spectroscopy are able to distinguish and identify intrinsic optical properties of tissues .   during the transition from normal to cancerous cells\n, biochemical , molecular , and morphologic alterations may lead to changes in the cells ' optical properties .\nindeed , recent studies have shown that elastic light - scattering spectroscopy may permit the earliest detection of carcinogenesis .\nlight - scattering spectroscopy ( lss ) is an optical technique in which quantitative information on cell organelle morphology is extracted via measurement of the spectra and angular distribution of backscattered light .\ntherefore , lss could detect precancerous and early cancerous changes in tissues . in this study , we investigated the novel technique confocal light absorption and scattering spectroscopic ( class ) microscopy to detect the light scattering differences in liquid - based cervical cell samples\n. class combines lss with confocal microscopy for early cancer detection [ 7 , 8 ] .\nclass provides not only size information but also the biochemical and physical properties of the cells .\nit images tissue at greater depth than conventional confocal microscopy and provides enhanced image contrast .\nin addition , by utilizing backscattered light to detect subcellular structures , class can detect changes in living cells without introducing exogenous labels .   in the present study\n, we demonstrate that class microscopy could distinguish between populations of normal , low - grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( lsil ) , and hsil cells ex vivo , and therefore could be developed for clinical use in the accurate and precise diagnosis of pap smear samples .\nforty women aged twenty and older who had a history of abnormal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study at the department of pathology , cancer hospital of fudan university , between 2009 and 2010 .\nof these 40 patients , 20 had cytologically confirmed hsil and 20 were non - hsil .\nall cytological samples were free of blood clot and stored at 4c for experimental procedures within 24  h. to perform class analysis , the cytological specimens were first put into thinprep preservation solution containing deionized water , 0.1% polysorbate 20 ( tween-20 ) detergent , and 54% ethanol .\nthe pathologist then mapped a region of interest , designating the region that contained the worst cell lesions .\ncells were suspended at 10  cells \/ ml to avoid overlapping nuclei in the analysis .\ncells in thinprep or in saline ( as the control ) were kept in an open volume container or dipped onto glass slides .\nmeasurements were made with a fiber optic probe placed on the surface of the cell suspension .   to perform the class analysis , we used a prototype class microscope as described in a previous report .\nafter the optical signal was collected by the class receiver , the data was analyzed using spectral data acquisition bwspec software ( b&w , newark , de , usa ) . before every experiment ,\nthe data was first normalized to the saline control samples and then comparisons were made between the hsil and non - hsil samples .\nsensitivity and specificity were calculated by percentage of cases correctly identified by class as compared to those confirmed by cytology , and then presented as mean  standard deviation ( sd ) .\nfrom patients with abnormal pap smear cytology results , we collected 20 cervical cytology samples of hsil , and 20 of non - hsil . in the hsil samples , the pathology report showed 6 cases with lesions of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( cin ) grade ii , and 14 cases with lesions of cin grade iii . in the non - hsil samples ,\n8 cases showed normal cytology , and 12 cases were positive for lsil ( table 1 ) .\none representative image each of normal , lsil , and hsil cells is shown in figure 1 ( left to right , resp . ) .\nwe chose cell samples from 4 , 7 , and 9 confirmed diagnosed normal , lsil , and hsil cytology specimens , respectively , for class analysis .   using class microscopy\n, these cells show a unclear edge , but bright nuclei . in the class method of cell imaging , enlarged nuclei become brighter ( figure 2 ) .\nthus , nuclei that have changed in size and condensation are detected by lss and are early indications of malignant transformation .\ndata collected from class analyses of hsil and non - hsil cytology samples were then analyzed by bwspec spectral data acquisition software and plotted ( figure 3 ) .\nspectrum wavelengths ( nm ) are represented on the abscissa , and the relative intensity is plotted on the ordinate scale .\nthe data summarizes the spectra of the scattering light reflections from cell nuclei , which were normalized to the control and liquid - based normal cells .   as illustrated in figure 3 ,\nthe red curve shows the trend of back scattering lights of non - hsil cells , and the blue curve represents the trend of back scattering lights of hsil cells .\nbetween 600 and 800  nm wavelengths , there were two peaks in the spectra curves , but the intensity differed in each . the hsil cells ( blue ) trended toward a higher relative intensity , and the non - hsil ( red ) trended relatively lower ( table 2 ) .\nhowever , although hsil cells trended higher in relative intensity , 4 of the 20  hsil cases did not have higher intensity compared to the non - hsil group .\nconversely , 2 of the 20 cases of non - hsil were higher in intensity compared to the hsil group .   comparing the trends of the hsil and non - hsil curves , the relative intensity of the hsil cells was obviously higher than that of the non - hsil at most wavelengths .\nthere was a significant difference between intensities of the hsil and non - hsil at 600 and 800  nm .\nhowever , there was no significant difference between them at wavelengths > 800  nm . sensitivity and specificity for hsil and non - hsil were 80% and 90% , respectively , compared to confirmed diagnosis by cytology .\ncervical cancer , unlike most other cancers , is relatively easy to prevent and diagnose early , which contributes to reduced incidence and a better long - term survival rate .\nhowever , advanced stages of cervical cancers continue to be a serious health problem worldwide , especially in developing countries .\nindeed , the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are increasing in young women in china , although mortality for this cancer has significantly decreased in the united states and western europe .\nthis may be due to the widespread use of the pap smear screening test and safer sex practices . in an effort to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the pap cytology test\nour data demonstrates that class microscopy was able to distinguish among normal , lsil , and hsil cells at specific wavelengths .\nclass microscopy is thus a useful and reliable technique for the detection of early cervical epithelial abnormality and could be used to help pathologists diagnose early cervical cancer .\nclinically it is crucial to distinguish precancerous lesions from normal and lsil , because precancerous lesions could progress to invasive carcinoma if left untreated .\nmany methods have been developed and used preclinically and clinically for the detection of early cervical cancer [ 10 , 11 ] .\nthe goals of investigations of new techniques are to reduce the cost of screening , enable the practical surveillance of populations , or to improve the sensitivity to hsils , which are considered cervical cancer precursors .\nelastic light scattering spectroscopy can provide a valuable , noninvasive means to quantitatively probe tissue morphology and even detect biochemical changes in cells .\nhowever , despite growing evidence of the clinical utility of a variety of light scattering - based optical techniques , the biological bases of differences in scattering signals between normal and neoplastic tissues are not well understood .   the rationale for using optical techniques is to detect biochemical and morphological features that are concurrent with precancerous conditions .\ntherefore , this kind of noninvasive method has many advantages , including the ability to measure changes in nuclear size , which is one of the recognized morphological changes occurring during the transformation of normal cells to cancerous .  \nsome studies have demonstrated that the intensity of light scattering increases with progression of atypia .\nthe most dramatic differences in scattering occur between non - hsil and hsil cells because changes in nuclear size and dna content are most pronounced between these two categories of cells .\nstudies have suggested that changes in scattering properties at high cin grades are dominated by the effects of increased nuclear size and increased dna content .\nin fact , a complex spatial pattern is formed that is dependent on cell size , shape , refraction index , density , and morphology . in this study\n, we used the optical method class to distinguish hsil of precancerous cervix cells from normal and lsil samples in liquid - based specimens ex vivo .\nwe found that class was able to differentiate these in confirmed cytology samples , by the non - hsil and hsil - relative intensity curves generated by the bwspec software .\nwe showed that there was a significant difference in relative intensity between non - hsil and hsil cells in the 600800  nm wavelength ranges .\nwe could discriminate hsil from non - hsil cervical epithelial cells by differences in the curves , which represented the median light - scattering intensities of confirmed samples .\nsixteen of the 20  hsil cases demonstrated higher trends in relative intensity , and 18 of the 20  non - hsil conformed to a lower trend in relative intensity .\ntherefore , in this study we established a novel model for diagnosis of liquid - based cervical cytological samples through the use of class microscopy . as reported previously , this method is noninvasive with high sensitivity .\nin addition , liquid - based specimens are easy to collect and preserve for analysis .  \nin addition , four cases of hsil did not differ from the lsil optimized curve . in the future\n, we will collect a larger number of samples to confirm our current data before translating this technique to the clinic .","abstract":" confocal light absorption and scattering spectroscopic ( class ) microscopy can detect changes in biochemicals and the morphology of cells . \n it is therefore used to detect high -

{"article":"the online version of this article ( doi:10.1007\/s00267 - 011 - 9751-z ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .\nhabitat fragmentation by transport networks and consequential secondary development has become one of the most serious global threats to biological diversity ( eea 2002 ; iuell and others 2003 ; laurance and others 2009 ; bentez - lpez and others 2010 ) . with more than 100 million km of roads worldwide\n( cia 2008 ) , the road network plays a main role in shaping the environment .\nroad effects have been widely studied and include biodiversity decline , environmental degradation , alteration of ecological processes and ecosystem services , and increases in both extinction and outbreak probabilities ( forman and alexander 1998 ; trombulak and frissell 2000 ; forman and others 2003 ; fahrig and rytwinski 2009 ) . by acting as a barrier\n, roads isolate populations , reduce the overall landscape connectivity and restrict ( or even block off ) gene flow for a wide variety of taxa ( keller and others 2004 ; epps and others 2005 ; riley and others 2006 ; balkenhol and waits 2009 ) . in a long term\n, this loss of genetic diversity and connectivity increases the extinction risk of populations and , reduces their ability to adapt to future global changes . in general , these effects are synergistic , extremely complex , cumulative and time - lagged ( forman and alexander 1998 ; findlay and bourdages 2000 ; mcgarigal and others 2001 ; forman and others 2003 ) . the spatial influence of these effects (  road - effect zone  ) ranges from a few meters to kilometres ( e.g. , forman and deblinger 2000 ) . when taking into account this road area - of - influence , about one fifth of the land in usa and the netherlands\nis ecologically affected by the road system ( reijnen and others 1995 ; forman 2000 ) .\nestimates indicate that only 18% of the usa lands are more than 1  km away from the closest road ( riitters and wickham 2003 ) .\nnot only major roads , but also minor and unpaved roads may have a considerable impact on the environment ( e.g. , van langevelde and others 2009 )\nnatural areas are being increasingly fragmented by a rapidly expanding transport network , together with urban sprawl ( eea 2006 , 2010 ) . in the case of usa forests , estimations yield about 11% of all forest located within 85  m of a road ( riitters and wickham 2003 ) .\nthe secondary impacts of roads account for an even more serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystem resilience .\nland use and transport networks are interdependent in complex ways ( wilkie and others 2000 ; eea 2006 ; mller and others 2010 ) .\nroads facilitate human access into formerly remote areas , accelerating land use change , habitat degradation and biodiversity loss , due to an increase in hunting , poaching , fishing , tourism , logging , mining , fires and urbanization ( trombulak and frissell 2000 ; wilkie and others 2000 ; hawbaker and others 2006 ) . urban development and sprawl\nare strongly linked to transport networks , also in rural and natural environments ( wilkie and others 2000 ; eea 2006 ; mller and others 2010 ) .\nthus , the density of transport infrastructures is a good indicator of the intensity of human activities and their impacts on biological diversity , and can be taken as a proxy for general disturbance levels ( e.g. , wilkie and others 2000 ; sanderson and others 2002 ; hawbaker and others 2006 ; theobald 2008 ; laurance and others 2009 ) .\nanthropogenic disturbances , in general , cause stress and reduce resilience and adaptive capacity of populations and species .\nthis is of special concern in the context of climate change , which is increasing local extinction rates and forcing latitudinal and elevational shifts in species ranges ( walther and others 2002 ; parmesan 2006 ) .\neurope , as the cradle of industrialization and vehicular transport , is probably the continent most highly fragmented by transport infrastructures . especially the eu-12 countries ( austria , belgium , denmark , finland , france , germany , ireland , italy , luxembourg , netherlands , sweden , united kingdom ) , historically highly developed and crowded , constitute the epicenter of habitat conversion and fragmentation ( pullin and others 2009 ) .\nit would be informative , for example , to differentiate between urban and rural roads , as well as among road types ( motorways , highways , minor roads ) . however , such specific data are available only regionally or even locally . taking into account these constraints\n( tent - t , a subset of the continent s overall road network targeted to support the economical integration of the eu ) in 2005 was 98,500  km , of which 78% corresponded to roads in eu-15 countries ( eu-12 plus greece , portugal , spain , data from tina 2008 ) . in a 10-year period ( 19952005 ) the length of  motorways  has increased by more than 13,000  km in the eu countries ( steer davies gleave 2009 ) .\nwhile eu plans imply slight increases of its total length , planned upgradings would increase the proportion of  motorways  in the network from 49% ( 2005 ) to 63% ( 2020 ) .\nthe land dedicated to transport networks continues to increase in the whole eu . in the period 19901998\napproximately 10  ha of land were taken for new motorway construction every day in the eu-15 ( eea 2002 ) .\nfor example , in the netherlands , on average 1  km of land is crossed by 3  km of asphalt road ( eea 2002 ) ; and the average size of polygons enclosed by the network of all roads is 1.14  km ( van langevelde and others 2009 ) . in belgium , transport infrastructure already occupies more than 4% of the country\nthe environmental consequences of this process may be different in the already highly fragmented eu-15 and in the new member states ( accessions from 2004 ; bulgaria , cyprus , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , romania , slovakia , slovenia , eu-27 ) with a lower density of roads and generally harbouring relatively well - preserved biodiversity and ecosystems , but where transport infrastructures are developing quickly after their accession .\nfragmentation by transport infrastructures in hungary and in the czech and slovak republics are already more severe than the eu-15 average . in the 1990s ,\ntotal motorway length doubled in the new members ( 2300  km built ) , while in the eu-15 it increased by almost one third ( 12000  km built , eea 2002 ) .\nmajor  transport infrastructures in the new members ( 174  km , eea 2002 , data from 1998 ) is still above the average of the eu-15 ( 121  km ) .\nhowever , differences between individual eu member states are more pronounced ; finland , and scandinavian countries in general , being the least fragmented in the continent , followed by countries in the carpathian region .\nmountainous countries , like italy or austria , still maintain relatively large unfragmented patches ( eea 2002 ) .\nthus , it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the few areas of low or no road fragmentation still existing in europe might be an important focus of future conservation efforts . in this paper ,\nthe term  roadless areas  refers to relatively large areas without any roads , whereas areas containing only roads with low - traffic intensity , below an established limit , are termed  low - traffic areas  ( see definition below ) . our main goal is to bring attention to the conservation value of roadless and low - traffic areas in europe , specifically in the eu .\nwe aim at ( 1 ) describing the benefits of roadless and low - traffic areas for biodiversity conservation ; ( 2 ) exploring how these areas are valued and considered in european legislation ; ( 3 ) assessing how low - traffic areas are protected as natura 2000 sites in germany , as a case study , comparing the western and eastern parts of the country ; and , ( 4 ) discussing the potential role of roadless and low - traffic areas to strengthen the effectiveness of the natura 2000 network , especially in the context of climate change and the unaccomplished goal of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 ( eu 2001 ; ec 2010 ) , as well as their integration into legal instruments and transport policies .\nroadless areas and , to a lesser extent , low - traffic areas , represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems .\nas at low traffic intensity , road impacts , such as the barrier effect for fauna , wildlife disturbance or pollution , are dampened ( iuell and others 2003 ; jaeger and others 2006 ; theobald 2008 ; charry and jones 2009 ) , it is sensible to assume that low - traffic areas may also represent sites of high conservation value , especially in europe , a human - dominated landscape . under this scenario , the ecological benefits described for roadless areas , which have been the focus of most research , may well apply to low - traffic areas as well .\nscientific evidence shows that roadless areas are critical in maintaining biodiversity , ecosystem processes , connectivity and overall ecosystem integrity .\nlarge , well - connected patches increase landscape connectivity and complement the network of protected areas ( e.g. , develice and martin 2001 ; loucks and others 2003 ; crist and others 2005 ) . thus , roadless areas sustain important elements of ecosystem integrity , such as the ability of species to move and natural processes to function .\nthey largely contribute to the preservation of native biodiversity and contain more species and individuals , species with large spatial requirements ( e.g. , top carnivores ) , and species sensitive to human disturbance ( haskell 2000 ; watkins and others 2003 ; angelstam and others 2004 ; blake and others 2008 ; chen and roberts 2008 ) .\nthey have the potential to ensure sufficient habitat for viable populations of species of conservation concern , as well as to increase the representation of rare ecological communities ( strittholt and dellasala 2001 ; loucks and others 2003 ; crist and others 2005 ) .\nthey serve as a barrier against pests , diseases ( of wildlife , livestock and humans , e.g. , the lyme disease ) and invasive species ( strittholt and dellasala 2001 ; allan and others 2003 ; gelbard and harrison 2003 ; holdsworth and others 2007 ; von der lippe and kowarik 2007 ) .\nit is in these large areas of unfragmented land that ecosystem services , vital for human societies , are rendered ( millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 ) .\nroadless and low - traffic areas are of special importance in the context of climate change because they are more resilient than areas more fragmented by roads , and because they have a vast buffering capacity ( mcgarigal and others 2001 ) .\ntheir ecosystem dynamics are still internally driven , as opposite to the dynamics of fragmented patches , which are predominantly driven by external forces ( saunders and others 1991 ) .\necosystems already fragmented and stressed by human activities will be more vulnerable to climatic threats , while large intact areas better resist and recover from climate change impacts ( markham 1996 ; laurance and williamson 2001 ; noss 2001 ; opdam and wascher 2004 ; ferguson and others 2008 )\n. these relatively undisturbed habitat patches can facilitate movements of organisms in the case of climate - forced range shifting .\nin general , they may represent  havens  for many species that are displaced from former habitats ( noss 2001 ; lovejoy 2006 ) . by slowing the rates of changes , moderating local climate , and being more diverse and resilient , roadless and low - traffic areas\nmay contribute to mitigate the effects of species phenology changes and trophic mismatches caused by climate change ( parmesan 2006 ) , and to facilitate species adaptation .\nespecially when comprising forest ecosystems or peatlands , roadless and low - traffic areas can play an important role in carbon fixation .\nundisturbed habitats may be better players in carbon sequestration than their fragmented and degraded counterparts ( harmon and others 1990 ; laurance and williamson 2001 ; ferguson and others 2008 ; luyssaert and others 2008 ) .\nit should be a relevant hypothesis to test that relatively carbon - rich ecosystem types in roadless and low - traffic areas store more carbon for maintaining a less stressed and thus more functional status . in the case of forests , in areas with poor access ( e.g. , in remote mountain areas )\nroadless and low - traffic areas also provide protection against the impacts of storm events , like flooding or landslides , and wildfires ( lower fire risk and higher resilience ; usda forest service 2000 , 2001 ; dellasala and frost 2001 ; laurance and williamson 2001 ; ferguson and others 2008 ) .\nthese relatively intact areas contribute to floodplain protection and drought abatement , as well as to maintain local climates stables and buffering weather extremes .\nthe social and economic benefits of roadless and low - traffic areas , such as recreation , have also been well documented ( noss 1991 ; loomis and richardson 2000 ; krieger 2001 ) .\nroadless and low - traffic areas , as lands with a relatively low human footprint and good conservation status , have been considered a priority in regional conservation planning in several countries outside europe .\nfor example , in bolivia , various conservation planning exercises on regional and national scales followed a functional approach and integrated roadless areas as surrogates for functional conservation targets , such as ecosystem processes and emergent features of biodiversity , especially required in the face of environmental change ( viability , resilience and adaptive capacity ; ibisch and others 2005 ) .\nhowever , the most ground - breaking initiative and important precedent has been the u.s . roadless area conservation rule of 2001 .\nit stated that 237,000  km within the u.s . national forest system ( 2% of us continental land )\nthe two inventories of roadless areas , rare i and rare ii , included unfragmented patches larger than 2024  ha ( an important part of which was designated as wilderness ) and 405  ha , respectively ( see usda forest service 2001 ; strittholt and dellasala 2001 ; turner 2006 , 2009 for details ) . in europe ,\ninitiatives specifically restricting road development in natural areas and giving special attention to the protection of roadless and low - traffic areas have hardly been launched .\nthe centerpiece of the eu nature conservation policy is the natura 2000 network , which consists of special protection areas and special areas of conservation delineated according to the provisions of the birds and habitats directives , respectively ( 79\/409\/eec and 92\/43\/eec , see pullin and others 2009 ) .\nalthough both european directives oblige the member states to take the appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of natura 2000 sites and to guarantee the long - term persistence of species and ecosystems , in practice they face enormous difficulties in avoiding habitat fragmentation .\nvery illustrative are recent conflicts like the planned construction of the via baltica express - way through the biebrza marshes , the unique rospuda mire and two large natural forests in northeastern poland ( eea 2006 ) .\nmoreover , a high proportion of natura 2000 sites is already in close proximity to major transport infrastructures and\/or will be potentially affected by the future development of the european transport network ( fisher and waliczky 2001 ; eea 2002 ) .\nwe conducted an exploration of european legal instruments , ranging from selected national laws to eu nature conservation directives and european conventions ( table  1 , see supplementary material ( appendix ) for detailed description of the laws ) .\nonly one of the explored laws considered roadless or low - traffic areas as a conservation target , although , paradoxically , the majority of them aimed at protecting other targets which are inherently and intimately related to fragmentation like connectivity , ecosystem processes or integrity . one important finding is an apparent conceptual shift from mere species and habitat protection ( e.g. , bern convention 1979 ) to more holistic approaches of ecosystem conservation , including processes , functions and aspects of integrity .\nwe especially consider the carpathian convention ( 2003 ) that explicitly addresses regulations of traffic impacts and development , and encourages the parties to develop sustainable transport policies .\ntraffic and energy infrastructure and similar projects shall be integrated so that fragmentation and consumption of the landscape as well as ecological impairment is avoided or reduced to a minimum \n( federal nature conservation act from 29 july 2009 ; table  1 ) . in spite of the apparent trend that european nature legislation is starting to consider minimising fragmentation by transport infrastructures , it is unfortunate that neither the eu nor the large majority of national laws recognise the significance of areas with low levels of fragmentation by roads in their conservation policies.table  1conservation targets and entities explicitly considered in selected european legal instruments , including conventions , european directives and national lawscountry or regionroadless and low - traffic areasecosystem servicesnatural resourcesecosystem integrityecosystem functioningecological processesconnectivitybiodiversitylandscapenatural ecosystemshabitatsnative species ( flora&fauna)natural heritagebern convention regionxx  alpine convention region  xxxxxxxxxxx  carpathian convention region  xxxxxxxxxxxxeuropean unionxxx  xxxxxxxgermanyxxx \n1 and supplementary material ( appendix ) for details of the countries included in each region and the respective laws .\nsymbol  x  indicates inclusion of targets and symbol    indicates exclusion ;

in 1990 they were unified again .\ndifferences in natural conditions , history , political regimes , social models and economic development between eastern and western germany illustrate well the differences between the so - called  western  and  eastern europe ,  once separated by the iron curtain .\ngermany lies in the transition zone between these two parts of europe ( fig . \nit reflects somehow different situations between the highly developed and industrialized countries in eu-15 and the new member states , more rural and less fragmented by transport infrastructures .\nthese two german regions also show strong differences in population density ; the  old  federal states ( former federal republic of germany ) have almost twice the population density of the  new  federal states ( former german democratic republic).fig . \n1map of europe indicating the members of the european union ( with a distinction of the new member states that have acceded since 2004 ) and the contracting parties under the alpine and carpathian convention map of europe indicating the members of the european union ( with a distinction of the new member states that have acceded since 2004 ) and the contracting parties under the alpine and carpathian convention germany is the first european country where data on the distribution and size of low - traffic areas have become available .\nthe german federal agency for nature conservation conducted a first inventory of large areas not cut by major transport infrastructures ( bfn 2008 ) , whose data were used for the present study ( federal agency for nature conservation , technical data on natura 2000 from 2008 , unpublished ) .\nthese low - traffic areas were defined as larger than 100  km and not dissected by roads with more than 1000 vehicles per day , by railway lines ( twin - track and single - track electrified lines ) or by human settlements , airports or channels ( with the status of a category iv federal waterway or above ) .\nthese criteria are generally applied in europe ( e.g. , andel and others 2005 ; jaeger and others 2007 ; bfn 2008 ) .\nalthough further research to identify threshold values for traffic volumes are needed , the value of 1000 vehicles per day seems to be an acceptable synthesis of the current ecological evidence and models and may serve as a preliminary basis for further discussions .\nbelow this threshold many , though certainly not all , populations of conservation - relevant species dissected by a road are thought to remain viable by several authors ( e.g. , hels and buchwald 2001 ; iuell and others 2003 ; seiler 2003 , 2005 ; jaeger and others 2006 ; charry and jones 2009 ) .\nwe superimposed the gis shape files of these low - traffic areas with those of natura 2000 sites in germany ( merging special areas of conservation and special protection areas , federal agency for nature conservation , technical data on moderately fragmented areas with low traffic intensity from 2006 , unpublished ) to analyze their spatial relationship .\nparticularly , our aim was to determine to what extent low - traffic areas are protected within the natura 2000 network and to what extent natura 2000 sites lie outside these areas . as the ecological coherence of the natura 2000 network is one of the main goals of the habitats directive , we were also interested in determining the degree of fragmentation of natura 2000 sites . for this purpose\n, we counted the number of spatially isolated subareas each natura 2000 site is composed of and analyzed the class size distribution of subareas for special areas of conservation and special protection areas separately .\nalthough the natura 2000 network covers an important proportion of the country ( 16% ; table  2 ; fig . \n2 ) , most low - traffic areas ( 75% ) lie outside the network and thus remain without protection .\nthis proportion is higher for the old federal states ( western germany ) , where only one fifth of low - traffic patches are protected .\nthe new federal states are much less fragmented , and about 45% of its surface consists of low - traffic areas , as against 18% in the old federal states .\nmore than half of the natura 2000 sites in germany lie outside low - traffic areas , especially in the old federal states ( 72% of the sites ; table  2 ) .\nnatura 2000 sites are highly fragmented , and often they consist of several subareas , many of which have a very small size .\nalmost 64% of these subareas classified as special areas of conservation are less than 50  ha ( fig .  3 ) .\nin the case of the special protection areas these figures are better ( 27% ) . in general , special areas of conservation comprise smaller subareas ; only 4% of them cover more than 1000  ha , against 26% in the case of special protection areas ( fig . \n3).table  2representation of low - traffic areas and natura 2000 sites in germany , with a distinction between the old and the new federal statesold federal statesnew federal stateswhole germanysurface248,884109,025357,909low - traffic areas45,161 ( 18%)48,843 ( 45%)94,004 ( 26%)natura 2000 sites33,662 ( 14%)23,753 ( 22%)57,415 ( 16%)low - traffic areas not covered by natura 2000 sites35,677 ( 79%)34,398 ( 70%)70,075 ( 75%)natura 2000 sites lying outside low - traffic areas24,178 ( 72%)9,308 ( 39%)33,486 ( 58%)the surface ( km ) and percentage of low - traffic areas , natura 2000 sites and their overlap are also indicated .\nlow - traffic areas are defined as larger than 100  km and crossed only by small roads with less than 1000 vehicles per day ( data from 2007 , bfn 2008)fig . \n3size class distribution of the subareas forming natura 2000 sites in germany : special protection areas ( birds directive ) and special areas of conservation ( habitats directive ) representation of low - traffic areas and natura 2000 sites in germany , with a distinction between the old and the new federal states the surface ( km ) and percentage of low - traffic areas , natura 2000 sites and their overlap are also indicated .\nlow - traffic areas are defined as larger than 100  km and crossed only by small roads with less than 1000 vehicles per day ( data from 2007 , bfn 2008 ) natura 2000 network and low - traffic areas coverage in germany size class distribution of the subareas forming natura 2000 sites in germany : special protection areas ( birds directive ) and special areas of conservation ( habitats directive )\nbiodiversity continues to decline in europe in spite of considerable conservation efforts carried out by administrations as well as non - governmental organisations ( ec 2010 ) .\nthe unaccomplished target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 ( eu 2001 ; ec 2010 ) calls for additional conservation measures to be put into practice as soon .\nfruit of this concern are recent initiatives of the european commission on defining targets beyond 2010 , developing  green infrastructures  or scaling up efforts to protect wilderness ( ep 2008 , 2009 ; ec 2011a , b ) .\nthe need to strengthen the natura 2000 network and adapt it to the rising challenges of climate change has also been highlighted . in this context ,\necosystem resilience and landscape connectivity are key goals that should be reinforced ( ep 2010a , b ) . the macis report ( berry and others 2008 ) states that to prevent and minimise future impacts of climate change on biological diversity in the eu , the minimization of fragmentation and the creation of connectors between protected areas is of extreme importance .\ntherefore , maintaining unfragmented large patches of natural habitats , i.e. , roadless and low - traffic areas , seems a prudent strategy under any climate change scenario .\nthe capacity of an ecosystem to preserve its integrity and biodiversity increases in large habitats that are well connected and which are far from the influence of external disturbances ( e.g. , fahrig and merriam 1985 ) .\nwe feel that there is enough evidence of the benefits of roadless and low - traffic areas for nature conservation , especially in the context of global change .\nthey represent sites with low human footprint , a high level of ecological integrity , and thus , intact ecosystem functioning and ongoing ecological processes , which translates into higher resilience and adaptive capacity . even in densely populated and intensively used landscapes , like germany\n, the remaining roadless and low - traffic areas may be of enormous value in supporting resilience and adaptive capacity of the biodiversity .\nin many areas of europe , it is probably too late to conserve roadless areas sensu stricto to a substantial extent . in this context ,\nthe last remnants are of special value , much more if they are primeval or close to a natural state .\nalthough the importance of keeping unfragmented large patches of natural habitats is increasingly recognised ( e.g. , jaeger and others 2006 ; charry and jones 2009 ; bentez - lpez and others 2010 ) , more research on the ecological benefits of both roadless and low - traffic areas in europe is deemed necessary .\nsuch research efforts should be accompanied by improving the quality and availability of road data ( e.g. , across road types  unpaved roads included  or differentiating between urban and rural roads ) and securing data coverage for the entire continent .\nconservation policies should focus not only on tangible elements , like species or habitats , but also include surrogates ( such as roadless areas ) of more abstract conservation targets , like ecosystem functioning , ecological processes or ecosystem services . the identification and inventory of the roadless and low - traffic areas in europe\na detailed inventory of these areas , based on sound and concrete criteria , and more detailed estimations of the level of fragmentation by roads in europe shall form the basis for a proper assessment of the magnitude of the problem . given the considerable impacts of minor and unpaved roads in natural ecosystems ( e.g. , reed and others 1996 ; riitters and wickham 2003 ; van langevelde and others 2009 ) , fragmentation and impact assessments should also consider them . as an example , in sweden , classically considered as one of the least fragmented countries in europe ( 400  km is the average size of non - fragmented land according to eea 2002 ) , the figures may look quite different when forest roads are taken into account . during the last decade ,\nthe rate of road construction in swedish forests has been approximately 1700  km per year , as a long - term goal of the forestry sector is to have no more than 500  m or 1000  m to the nearest road in southern and northern sweden , respectively ( swedish forest agency 2008 ) .\ndata on the habitat types covered by roadless and low - traffic areas and their overlap with the natura 2000 network should be compulsory in europe .\nstronger scientific evidence on traffic and area thresholds following an ecosystem approach is needed ; in general , road research needs to effectively address questions of direct management relevance and design studies that have high inferential strength , e.g. evaluating impacts before and after road construction ( gontier and others 2006 ; roedenbeck and others 2007 ) . as a second step , inventoried roadless and low - traffic areas should be considered in european legal instruments in a more explicit way .\nfortunately , european legislation has just started to take them into account . in this sense , the recent carpathian convention and the german federal conservation act are among the most progressive legal instruments in europe ( see table  1 ) . the urgent need to protect large , undisturbed habitat patches in europe\n, the european parliament adopted the report on wilderness in europe ( ep 2008 , 2009 ) that calls on the commission for better protection of wild areas , as a means for climate protection and maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity . in this context , a \nanother possible step would be to include roadless and low - traffic areas in the habitats directive , either within a new annex of functional targets complementing and facilitating the adaptation of the natura 2000 network to climate change , or even as a new category of site . whether a special protection category or designation of these areas is needed or not , large natural areas without roads are protected de facto . mirroring the us legislation\n, the main goal would be to protect roadless and low - traffic areas from further road development , namely building new roads , increase of traffic volume on existing small roads and use of off - road vehicles .\ninclusion of roadless and low - traffic areas in the national and eu biodiversity strategies would also be desirable .\nonly after being inventoried and receiving a  legal status  , roadless and low - traffic areas could be properly integrated into transport and spatial planning . the environmental impact assessment ( eia , 85\/337\/eec ) and the strategic environmental assessment directives ( sea , 2001\/42\/eec ) are essential instruments to assess the impacts from transport infrastructures and for the integration of ecological issues into spatial planning ; however the quality of ecological assessments is still limited ( e.g. , inappropriate criteria and methods , local approach , lack of integration between ecological and landscape assessments , gontier and others 2006 ; joumard and nicolas 2010 ) .\nthe consideration of biodiversity in environmental assessments requires a holistic approach , i.e. , to scale - up to the ecosystem level and to link local and global aspects ( gontier and others 2006 ; joumard and nicolas 2010 ) .\na concrete step towards the accomplishment of this vision will be to consider roadless and low - traffic areas in environmental assessments .\nbearing in mind the strong meaning of the term ( e.g. , joumard and nicolas 2010 ) , a sustainable and conservation - sound planning of the european transport network should take into account the still existing roadless and low - traffic areas . especially in the new member states , containing highly valuable areas but where transport networks are developing at a brisk pace , more sustainable transport policies are necessary .\nresearch shows that , whenever possible , the design of new routes should avoid dissecting remote and roadless areas ( jaeger and others 2006 ; forman 2007 ; charry and jones 2009 ; bentez - lpez and others 2010 ) .\nstudies on road animal mortality , population persistence and road configuration ( jaeger and others 2006 ; charry and jones 2009 ) support the  bundling traffic  concept , concluding that ( 1 ) the road network should leave areas as large as possible free from disturbances due to traffic , ( 2 ) traffic should be concentrated on highly travelled roads , and ( 3 ) when traffic can not be combined on one road , it is better to bundle roads close together than to distribute them evenly across the landscape .\nthus , in natural areas with low level of fragmentation and human footprint ( e.g. , crossed by small roads ) , the general recommendation is to prevent increases in traffic volume ( charry and jones 2009 ) .\nwhen avoidance of habitat fragmentation is not possible , mitigation measures and strategies to maintain landscape connectivity , like ecological corridors , should be designed ( iuell and others 2003 ) .\nso far , scientific evidence of their effectiveness from a genetic point of view is still needed ( corlatti and others 2009 ) . in minor roads ,\ntraffic calming is another type of intervention used to mitigate negative impacts by reducing traffic volumes and speeds , and which has been shown to increase the persistence on animal populations in areas with a dense road network ( van langevelde and jaarsma 2009 ) .\nroad closure , especially in remote areas , has also been suggested as a measure to decrease fragmentation ( berry and others 2008 ; charry and jones 2009 ) .\nintegrated solutions are obliged to include urban planning . given the magnitude of urban sprawl in europe , also affecting natural habitats ( eea 2006 ) , an equally important goal should be to impede secondary effects along existing roads in roadless and low - traffic areas .\nthis is of high concern in countries lacking spatial plans in most of their surface ( e.g. , poland ) and where roads are inevitably followed by urban development .\nthe implementation of sustainable development schemes at large spatial scales , linking long and short terms , as well as local and global issues , would prevent the degradation of the integrity of roadless and low - traffic areas and thus , of their contribution to ecosystem and landscape resilience .\nclearly , in the preservation of roadless areas and sustainable development of low - traffic areas , synergies of nature conservation and other societal goals are manifold .\njust to name a few examples , traffic calming also benefits health and well - being ( less accidents , noise and pollution ) , and water provision to society generally improves in volume and quality with the functionality of roadless and low - traffic areas ( e.g. , van langevelde and jaarsma 2009 ) .\nsuch synergies make roadless areas and low - traffic areas worth considering by a variety of stakeholders beyond the conservation community . with broader societal support ,\nroads have brought benefits to human societies for centuries . in the current situation of road encroachment ,\nbiodiversity crisis and global and climate change , roadless and low - traffic areas may far exceed roaded areas in the benefits provided .\nwe call for a pan - european conservation strategy defining relatively unfragmented and low- footprint areas (  roadless and low - traffic areas  ) regardless of their biotic characteristics as conservation targets . further scientific evidence on their ecological benefits and further research to answer key questions in road ecology regarding low - traffic and roadless areas under the different conditions in european countries is urgently needed .\nconservation scientists and administrations should join forces to halt the loss of biodiversity in europe , to keep healthy and resilient ecosystems and to preserve the services they provide . preserving the\nbelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material . \n  supplementary material 1 ( docx 19  kb )","abstract":" with increasing road encroachment , habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for european biodiversity . \n areas with no roads or little traffic (  roadless and low - traffic areas  ) represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems . \n they provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies ( e.g. , landscape connectivity , barrier against pests and invasions , ecosystem services ) . \n roadless and low - traffic areas , with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances , are of special relevance in europe because of their rarity and , in the context of climate change , because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems . \n an analysis of european legal instruments illustrates that , although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation , like connectivity , ecosystem processes or integrity , roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target . \n a case study in germany underlines this finding . \n although the natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country ( 16% ) , natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low - traffic areas ( 75% ) lie unprotected outside this network . \n this proportion is even higher for the old federal states ( western germany ) , where only 20% of the low - traffic areas are protected . \n we propose that the few remaining roadless and low - traffic areas in europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts ; they should be urgently inventoried , included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning . considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the natura 2000 network to climate change.electronic supplementary materialthe online version of this article ( doi:10.1007\/s00267 - 011 - 9751-z ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .

fitting function in sigmaplot ( systat software inc . ,\nsince we only had access to clade 2 isolates from indonesia , we do not know whether this decreased sensitivity occurs only in the indonesian clade 2 isolates or globally with all clade 2 isolates\n. comparisons of the sequences in the public databases show several mutations in the stalk region , which vary between clade 1 and clade 2 nas , but 1 mutation in the globular head , h252y , varies between all clade 1 and clade 2 isolates .\na further 3-aa variation occurs in most clade 1 and clade 2 nas , s343p , e387 g , and g459s ( n2 numbering ) , including the indonesian isolates studied here .\nan additional v338 m variation is found in most indonesian isolates , including the ones studied here ( sequences submitted by n. komadina ) .\nthe a \/ indonesia \/ wates\/77\/2005 na has an additional unique i117v variation , which is adjacent to one of the catalytic arginines , r118 ( which would be consistent with a further effect on drug sensitivity to oseltamivir ) , and a slight decrease in sensitivity to zanamivir ( 2.3 nmol \/ l vs mean of 1.4\nwe have shown here that , compared with clade 1 isolates from 2004 , some clade 1 cambodian isolates and clade 2 indonesian isolates from 2005 demonstrate reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir . because none of the sequence variations in the public databases correlates with any mutation known to confer oseltamivir resistance , and none of the variations are in the active site ( 10 ) , this suggests that the decrease in sensitivities may be due to drift mutations rather than from exposure to oseltamivir .\nrecent results show that human isolates can also demonstrate decreased sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir with drift mutations in the na remote from the active site ( 11 ) .\nthe difference in the amino acid at position 252 may partially account for the altered binding between the clade 1 and clade 2 nas as other researchers have suggested that the amino acid at position 252 can affect reorientation of the e276 ( 4,10 ) . in clade 1 nas , this is normally subtype h252 , but all clade 2 nas have subtype y252 . in\nthe recently published n1 structure , although it is from a clade1 subtype h5n1 nas , the authors had mutated the na to subtype y252 ( 10 ) , which is also found in human nas . the e276 in this structure\ndoes not appear to have undergone full reorientation , which could contribute to reduced oseltamivir binding found in the indonesian clade 2 isolates here .\ntesting the sensitivities of both nas would provide valuable information on the role of subtype h252\n. however , mutational analysis of the indonesian and cambodian isolates and structure determinations of the different nas are necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of altered binding .\nthe specific decrease in sensitivity to oseltamivir of both 2005 cambodian clade 1 and especially the indonesian clade 2 influenza ( h5n1 ) isolates is disturbing , especially since they maintain their pathogenicity and transmissibility in birds and are clearly pathogenic in humans , since indonesia has the highest death rate from influenza ( h5n1 ) infections of any country .\nthis finding is in contrast to recent observations that mutations conferring zanamivir resistance in human strains have poor viability and are not genetically stable ( 12 ) .\nsuch a decrease in oseltamivir sensitivity could lead to suboptimal drug dosing in treating persons infected with these isolates , which is thought to facilitate selection of viruses with a high level of resistance ( 13 ) .\nseveral groups have reported the emergence of resistant viruses in clade 1infected influenza ( h5n1 ) patients treated with oseltamivir and suggested that higher doses of oseltamivir may be needed ( 1,8 ) .\nbecause the clade 2 viruses studied here have a 15- to 30-fold decrease in sensitivity compared to the clade 1 viruses , this suggests the standard dosing of oseltamivir may be even less effective in treating clade 2 influenza ( h5n1)infected patients .\nmany laboratories are developing rapid pcr sequencing methods for detecting the known mutation ( h274y ) that confers high - level resistance in influenza ( h5n1 ) viruses .\nhowever , we have shown here the importance of phenotypic testing of isolates in an enzyme assay rather than just genotypic screening ( 14 ) .\nbecause the clade 2 virus is now spread through parts of europe and africa , continued global collaboration and phenotypic testing of drug sensitivity of circulating highly pathogenic avian isolates for na inhibitor sensitivity are critical .\nno altered sensitivity to zanamivir occurred , which further supports the hypothesis of minimalist drug design ( 15 ) and of maintaining the inhibitor as close as possible to the natural substrate to minimize the emergence of resistance .","abstract":" we tested the neuraminidase drug sensitivity of clade 1 and clade 2 influenza a virus ( h5n1 ) . \n all viruses demonstrated similar sensitivity to zanamivir , but compared to the 2004 clade 1 viruses , the cambodian 2005 viruses were 6-fold less sensitive and the indonesian clade 2 viruses were up to 30-fold less sensitive to oseltamivir .

{"article":"cyp4fs are a family of cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) enzymes that were first identified for their ability to catalyze end - chain hydroxylation and inactivation of leukotriene b4 ( ltb4 ) .\nthe potency of ltb4 as an inflammatory mediator in normal immune responses and pathologies is well established .\nltb4 is generated by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and is implicated in the progression of diverse immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease , ischemia - reperfusion injury ( iri ) , arthritis , and asthma [ 2 , 3 ] .\ntherefore , cyp4fs are predicted to play a significant role in the regulation of inflammation and prevention of disease .\nthere is growing evidence to support this possibility . cyp - dependent ltb4 hydroxylase activity limits neuroinflammation in mouse models   and might contribute to the beneficial effects of retinoids in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases [ 5 , 6 ] .\nneutrophils and colonic mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel disease have reduced ltb4 hydroxylase activity [ 7 , 8 ] , and genetic association studies link variants of the cyp4f2 and cyp4f3 genes with celiac disease and crohn 's disease [ 9 , 10 ] .\nhuman neutrophils have been used for detailed studies of cyp - dependent ltb4 metabolism : hydroxylation at the terminal (  ) position generates 20-hydroxy ltb4 , which is subsequently converted to the inactive metabolite 20-carboxy ltb4 .\nthis is the major pathway for the inactivation of ltb4 in human neutrophils [ 12 , 13 ] .\nthe enzyme responsible for the initial -hydroxylation step was identified as cyp4f3 [ 14 , 15 ] , and subsequently we demonstrated that this enzyme is an alternative splice form of the cyp4f3 gene designated as cyp4f3a .\na second splice form , cyp4f3b , has lower activity for ltb4 and is expressed in different locations such as liver and kidney . the unusual localization and high expression of cyp4f3a in human neutrophils , and\nits high activity for ltb4 as a substrate , suggest that inactivation of ltb4 is a specialized function of the enzyme .\nthere is evidence for temporal expression of cyp4fs consistent with the resolution phase of inflammation in some experimental models , but expression of cyp4f3a in neutrophils does not fit this time frame .\nneutrophils are short - lived cells associated with the early stages of inflammation , and cyp4f3a is expressed at a high constitutive level both before and during inflammatory recruitment of the cells .\nit is possible that ltb4 inactivation functions to restrain neutrophil infiltration and prevent excessive inflammation .\nan alternative possibility is that ltb4 inactivation plays a role in neutrophil polarization , which is required to maintain normal chemotaxis .\nwe developed mouse models to better understand the role of cyp4fs in neutrophil - dependent inflammation .\nwe identified the cyp4f18 enzyme as the mouse homologue of cyp4f3a   and generated targeted deletions in the cyp4f18 gene .\nneutrophils from cyp4f18 knockout mice exhibit a null phenotype for end - chain hydroxylation of ltb4 . however , there are significant differences between mice and humans .\nthe cyp4f18 gene is not alternatively spliced and generates a single enzyme that is homologous to cyp4f3a in sequence , localization to neutrophils , and high activity for ltb4 .\nthe products of end - chain hydroxylation by cyp4f18 are 19-hydroxy ltb4 , and to a lesser extent 18-hydroxy ltb4 , not 20-hydroxy ltb4 [ 21 , 22 ] .\nit is not known whether -1 and -2 hydroxylation of ltb4 represents an efficient inactivation pathway .\nfurthermore , mouse neutrophils have an alternative pathway of ltb4 metabolism that involves a 12-hydroxydehydrogenase .\nknockout of cyp4f18 does not impact neutrophil infiltration into kidney tissue and disease pathology in a mouse model of renal iri , although inhibition of ltb4 synthesis does have observable effects in this model .\nit appears that cyp4f18 is redundant for ltb4 inactivation in mouse neutrophils , and we speculated that it might have an alternative function in these cells . since the discovery of cyp4fs , numerous in vitro substrates have been identified .\nthere are 7 members of the human cyp4f family including the two splice forms of cyp4f3 ( 4f2 , 4f3a , 4f3b , 4f8 , 4f11 , 4f12 , and 4f22 ) and 9 members of the mouse family ( 4f13 , 4f14 , 4f15 , 4f16 , 4f17 , 4f18 , 4f37 , 4f39 , and 4f40 ) .\ncyps typically have broad and overlapping substrate specificity , and a single enzyme such as cyp4f3b might have the capacity to catalyze multiple reactions including inactivation of ltb4 , generation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( 20-hete ) , and modification of fatty acid epoxides [ 1 , 24 ] .\nthis suggests potentially diverse and prominent roles for cyp4fs in immune regulation but creates a challenge for the identification of physiologically relevant substrates .\nit is possible that cyp4fs have different functions in different tissue locations , and new experimental systems will be required to determine the significance of particular reactions and disentangle the effects of multiple cyp4fs .\ncyp4f18 is the only cyp4f family member expressed at high levels in mouse neutrophils , so cyp4f18 knockout mice provide a novel system to dissect diversity of function . in this report\nwe demonstrate that neutrophils from cyp4f18 knockout mice show increased chemotaxis to complement component c5a that is independent of ltb4 , an unexpected result that is not predicted by known cyp4f substrates .\n\n cyp4f18 knockout ( \/ ) mice were generated in a c57bl\/6 background as previously reported   and are available at the mutant mouse regional resource center ( mmrrc ) with the designation b6.129s4(cg)-cyp4f18 .\ncyp4f18 + \/ heterozygous mice were maintained at the massachusetts general hospital and mated to generate cyp4f18 \/ homozygous knockouts and cyp4f18 + \/+ wild - type littermates for experiments .\nbreeding and experimentation of mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the massachusetts general hospital \/ partners committee on research animal care .\nmouse bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs and tibias by perfusion with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .\nthe cells were filtered through a 40  m cell strainer , washed in pbs , and layered on top of a discontinuous two - layer gradient of histopaque 1077\/1119 ( sigma ) .\nafter centrifugation at 700  g for 30  min at rt , neutrophils were separated from other cells including erythrocytes and recovered at the interface of the 1077 and 1119 fractions .\npurity of the isolated polymorphonuclear cells was confirmed ( > 90% ) by staining nuclei with dapi and examination under a nikon eclipse ti microscope with confocal imaging .\nbone marrow neutrophils were isolated as described above and resuspended in migration medium ( rpmi + 0.5% fbs ) to a concentration of 3  10 cells \/ ml .\nchemotaxis was performed using a 12-well plate with transwell 12  mm polycarbonate membrane inserts of 3.0  m pore size ( corning 3402 ) .\nthe cells were placed in the insert ( 0.5  ml , 1.5  10 cells per insert ) , and 1.5  ml of migration medium containing different concentrations of chemoattractant was placed in the lower well .\nmigration medium containing vehicle but no chemoattractant was used as a control to measure background chemotaxis , and chemoattractant was added to both the insert and the lower well as a control for chemokinesis .\nthe 12-well plates were incubated for 3 hours at 37c in a 5% co2 incubator .\nthe medium in the lower well was transferred to a 12  75  mm sterile culture tube ( bd falcon ) , and the well was washed with pbs .\nthe tubes were then centrifuged for 5  min at 200  g , and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.1  ml migration medium .\nthe total number of cells was determined using a hemocytometer . to calculate the chemotactic index ,\nthe number of cells migrated in response to chemoattractant was divided by the number of spontaneously migrated cells ( background ) .\nthe chemoattractants tested were ltb4 ( cayman ) , mouse complement component c5a ( r&d systems ) , mouse cxcl1\/kc ( r&d systems ) , and wkymvdm peptide ( sigma ) as an agonist for the mouse formyl peptide receptor . in some experiments\n, bone marrow neutrophils were incubated with or without inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis or blt1 for 30  min at 37c prior to adding the cells to the 12-well plate inserts .\nthis included incubations with 0.5  m of the flap inhibitor mk 886 ( cayman 10133 ) , 1  m of a cpla2 inhibitor ( calbiochem 525143 , pubchem cid 9833099 ) , and 10  m of the blt1 antagonist ly223982 ( cayman 10010024 ) .\neach experimental condition was performed in duplicate or triplicate on a single 12-well plate , and each experiment was performed at least 4 times ( n  4 ) .\nbone marrow cell suspensions in pbs + 0.5% bsa were preincubated with mouse fc block ( bd biosciences ) for 5  min at 4c ( 0.5  g\/10 cells\/100  l ) and then incubated with fluorophore -

type was performed by the ct method using mouse gapdh as endogenous control .\neach sample was run in triplicate to determine ct values , 2 values , or fold - differences in expression ( 2 ) .\nthe taqman primer - probe sets were purchased from life technologies ( applied biosystems ) as listed in table 1 .\ndss ( mp biomedicals ) of average molecular weight 42  kda ( 3550,000 ) was administered to 8-week - old mice ad libitum at a concentration of 4% in drinking water for 9 days .\ncontrol mice received the same drinking water without dss ( n = 10 mice in each group ) .\nchanges in body weight were calculated every day . a disease activity index ( dai )\nwas determined by assigning a score of 14 for weight loss ( 1 : 15% , 2 : 510% , 3 : 1015% , and 4 : > 15% ) , rectal bleeding ( ranging from 1 : positive to 4 : gross bleeding ) , stool consistency ( ranging from 1 : loose stools to 4 : diarrhea with fecal material adherent to anal fur ) , and body posture \/ lethargy ( ranging from 1 : mild to 4 : severe ) .\nthe total scores were averaged to give a value between 0 ( normal ) and 4 ( maximum ) .\nmice were sacrificed on day 9 , and colonic tissue samples were collected for further analysis .\nmyeloperoxidase ( mpo ) was measured using an elisa kit from hycult biotech ( hk210 ) .\nthe assay was performed on tissue samples that had been frozen and stored at 70c .\nthe samples were thawed , weighed , and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 200  mm nacl , 5  mm edta , 10  mm tris , 10% glycerin , 1  mm pmsf , 1  g \/ ml leupeptin , and 28  g \/ ml aprotinin , ph 7.4 ( 20  l lysis buffer per mg tissue ) .\nthe homogenate was transferred to a 1.5  ml microfuge tube and centrifuged two times at 1500  g for 15  min at 4c .\na t - test was used for comparisons of paired data , and multigroup data were analyzed by anova .\nltb4-dependent chemotaxis of neutrophils from wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout c57bl\/6 mice was compared using an in vitro assay .\na dose - dependent increase in chemotaxis was observed ( figure 1 ) . for wild - type ( wt ) neutrophils ,\nthe chemotactic index increased from 1.27  0.12 at 1  nm ltb4 to 2.73  0.7 at 10  nm ltb4 and 8.53  0.64 at 100  nm ltb4 . for cyp4f18 knockout ( ko )\nneutrophils , the chemotactic index increased from 1.4  0.1 at 1  nm ltb4 to 3.3  0.77 at 10  nm ltb4 and 9.27  0.77 at 100  nm ltb4 . at each concentration\n, there was no significant difference between the chemotactic index for wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils ( n = 10 , p > 0.05 ) .\nthe complement component c5a was originally used as a control in these experiments , because c5a - dependent chemotaxis was not expected to be affected by loss of cyp4f18 .\nsurprisingly , significant differences in chemotaxis were observed when comparing wild - type and knockout neutrophils ( figure 2 ) . for wild - type neutrophils ,\nthe chemotactic index increased from 1.7  0.46 at 1  ng \/ ml c5a to 4.79  0.48 at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 9.2  0.79 at 100  ng \/ ml c5a . for cyp4f18 knockout ( ko )\nneutrophils , the chemotactic index increased from 2.2  0.38 at 1  ng \/ ml c5a to 11.2  1.1 at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 17.3  1.7 at 100  ng \/ ml c5a .\nthere was a significant difference between the chemotactic index for wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils at 10  ng \/ ml c5a ( p < 0.01 ) and 100  ng \/ ml c5a ( p < 0.05 ) , but not at 1  ng \/ ml c5a ( figure 2(a ) ) .\noverall , the relative difference in chemotactic index for knockout compared to wild - type was 2.3-fold at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 1.9-fold at 100  ng \/ ml c5a ( figure 2(b ) ) . no significant differences between cyp4f18 knockout and wild - type neutrophil chemotaxis\nwere observed when cxcl1\/kc or wkymvdm peptide was used as chemoattractant ( data not shown ) .\nprevious studies demonstrated that ltb4 is a signal relay molecule during neutrophil chemotaxis : ltb4 synthesis and secretion are induced by primary chemoattractants such as c5a , and this amplifies neutrophil migration [ 20 , 26 ] .\nthe amplification is reduced by mk 886 , a flap inhibitor that is known to block 5-lipoxygenase activation and leukotriene synthesis .\nas expected , we observed a decrease in c5a - dependent chemotaxis in neutrophils treated with mk 886 ( figure 2(a ) ) , but the decrease was equivalent in wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils ( 0.450.56-fold ) , such that the relative difference in chemotactic index remained unchanged : 2.21-fold higher in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils compared to wild - type at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 1.92-fold higher at 100  ng \/ ml c5a ( figure 2(b ) ) .\nsimilar results were obtained when neutrophils were treated with a cpla2 inhibitor : there was an equivalent decrease in c5a - dependent chemotaxis in wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils of 0.30.37-fold ( figure 2(a ) ) , and the relative difference in chemotactic index remained unchanged : 2.3-fold higher in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 1.75-fold higher at 100  ng \/ ml c5a ( figure 2(b ) ) .\nthe cpla2 inhibitor is less specific than the flap inhibitor : it blocks eicosanoid production by preventing release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids   and therefore inhibits synthesis of a wide range of lipid mediators in addition to leukotrienes .\noverall , the data show that loss of cyp4f18 results in increased neutrophil chemotaxis to c5a and suggest that this is independent of ltb4 and other eicosanoids .\nly223982 is a synthetic blt1 ( ltb4 receptor ) antagonist that has been used to study neutrophil function .\nwe incubated neutrophils with ly223982 prior to chemotaxis assays using 10  ng \/ ml c5a .\nthis resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in c5a - dependent chemotaxis in wild - type neutrophils and a 2-fold increase in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils , compared to cells that were not treated with ly223982 ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nthere is previous evidence for cross - desensitization between neutrophil chemoattractant receptors , and this might account for our data : less cross - desensitization of the c5a receptor following inhibition of blt1 could result in an increased chemotactic response to c5a .\nhowever this does not account for the differences between cyp4f18 knockout and wild - type neutrophils , because the relative difference in chemotactic index remained undiminished following treatment with ly223982 : 2.8-fold higher in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils compared to wild - type ( figure 2(b ) ) .\nwe have previously used multicolor flow cytometry analysis of cells from mouse bone marrow and other tissues to investigate protein expression in different cell lineages [ 19 , 22 ] .\nly6 g is a component of the myeloid marker gr-1 ( ly6 g + ly6c ) that is preferentially expressed in neutrophils , and fluorophore - conjugated monoclonal antibodies to ly6 g are useful to identify neutrophils in flow cytometry studies . using this approach ,\nmouse bone marrow cells were stained with anti - ly6g - fitc and anti - c5ar - apc , and analysis of double plots shows an equivalent level of c5a receptor ( c5ar ) expression in neutrophils from cyp4f18 knockout and wild - type mice ( figure 3(a ) ) .\nreal time pcr analysis of isolated bone marrow neutrophils ( figure 3(b ) ) determined that there is no significant difference in mrna expression of c5ar or blt1 in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils compared to wild - type ( n = 4 , p > 0.05 ) .\na plot of 2 values shows that c5ar is expressed at approximately 10-fold higher levels than blt1 in the cells ( figure 3(b ) ) .\nthe values for relative expression ( 2 ) of c5ar in knockout neutrophils compared to wild - type ranged from 0.92 to 1.05 .\na real time pcr assay designed to detect exons 8 and 9 of cyp4f18 was used to confirm loss of expression of these exons in knockout mice , as previously described .\nwe routinely performed real time pcr analysis of isolated bone marrow neutrophils to determine if changes in expression of other cyp genes might account for differences in the cyp4f18 knockout .\nwe have previously shown that cyp4f18 is the predominant cyp4f subfamily member in bone marrow neutrophils and that cyp4f13 and cyp4f16 are detected at lower levels . in this study\n, we extended the analysis to include all cyp4 family members in mouse ( figure 3(c ) ) .\nimportantly , there were no changes in cyp4 expression in knockout neutrophils that might compensate for the loss of cyp4f18 or lead to differences in activity of the cells . a mouse model of dss colitis\nwas used to investigate the consequences of increased c5a - dependent chemotaxis in vivo ( figure 4 ) .\ninhibition of c5a activity has been shown to reduce disease pathology in this model in c57bl\/6 mice .\ncontinuous administration of 4% dss in drinking water to 8-week - old mice resulted in a rapid decline in body weight from 98.7  1.35% of initial weight on day 6 to 78.5  3.8% of initial weight on day 9 in wild - type mice .\nthere was a corresponding increase in disease activity index ( maximum = 4 ) from 1.3  0.29 on day 6 to 3.2  0.24 on day 9 .\nthere were no significant differences in the values for loss of weight or increase in disease activity in cyp4f18 knockout mice ( n = 10 , p > 0.05 ) .\nmpo , an enzyme produced mainly by neutrophils , was measured in colonic tissue to quantify inflammatory cell infiltration ( figure 5 ) . on day 9 ,\nthe mpo level was 57  9.0  ng \/ mg tissue in wild - type mice and 55  7.1  ng \/ mg tissue in cyp4f18 knockout mice ( n = 5 , p > 0.05 ) .\nbased on the similarity of these indicators , we did not proceed with further histological analysis of colon tissue .\nwe previously generated cyp4f18 knockout mice , and predicted that the mice would exhibit altered ltb4-dependent inflammation based on the ability of the cyp4f18 enzyme to metabolize ltb4 in neutrophils .\nhowever , there were no significant differences in inflammation and injury in a mouse model of renal iri compared to wild - type , although inhibition of ltb4 synthesis does ameliorate pathology in this model .\nthe results of an in vitro chemotaxis assay are consistent with these previous observations in vivo .\nltb4 stimulated chemotaxis of neutrophils in a dose - dependent manner , but there were no significant differences in the response of cyp4f18 knockout and wild - type cells ( figure 1 ) .\nin the renal iri model , we measured infiltration of neutrophils into kidney tissue by traditional histological approaches and flow cytometry and demonstrated a comparable time course and magnitude of infiltration in cyp4f18 knockout and wild - type mice .\nhowever , the loss of cyp4f18 might be compensated by other cyp4fs in the complex tissue physiology of inflammation .\nthe in vitro assay reported here confirms that the similarity between wild - type and knockout is inherent to neutrophils .\nthere are a number of possible explanations for the unaltered chemotactic response to ltb4 in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils .\ncyp4f18 converts ltb4 to 19-hydroxy ltb4 , and to a lesser extent 18-hydroxy ltb4 , in mouse neutrophils , not 20-hydroxy ltb4 as seen in humans .\nthese products were not detected in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils , but it is not known whether -1 and -2 hydroxylation of ltb4 represents an efficient inactivation pathway .\nit is sometimes difficult to distinguish the  , -1 , and -2 metabolites of cyp hydroxylases , but this can have physiological and pharmacological importance .\nfor example , 19-hete is produced by a number of cyps and is an antagonist of 20-hete .\nwe have provided experimental details for the identification of 18- and 19-hydroxy ltb4 [ 21 , 22 ] , but further studies are needed to clarify the roles of these metabolites .\nanother possibility is that cyp4f18 is redundant for ltb4 metabolism , because mouse neutrophils have an alternative pathway for ltb4 inactivation involving a 12-hydroxydehydrogenase that is not affected in cyp4f18 knockouts .\nwe speculated that cyp4f18 might have an alternative function in mouse neutrophils and that its homologue evolved to be the dominant ltb4-metabolizing enzyme in humans coincident with its ability to generate 20-hydroxy ltb4 .\nunexpectedly , a difference in response to complement component c5a was identified using the in vitro chemotaxis assay .\ncompared to wild - type neutrophils , cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils show an increase in chemotaxis of 2.3-fold at 10  ng \/ ml c5a and 1.9-fold at 100  ng \/ ml c5a ( figure 2 ) .\nprimary chemoattractants such as c5a stimulate ltb4 synthesis and secretion , which amplifies neutrophil chemotaxis [ 20 , 26 ] .\ntherefore , it is possible that increased c5a - dependent chemotaxis in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils might be caused by increased levels of ltb4 or other eicosanoids arising from endogenous synthesis .\nwe used two different inhibitors to investigate this possibility : a flap inhibitor ( mk 886 ) that blocks activation of 5-lipoxygenase and a cpla2 inhibitor that blocks eicosanoid production by preventing release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids .\nthese inhibitors reduced c5a - dependent chemotaxis to an equivalent degree in both wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils , such that the relative difference in knockout cells compared to wild - type remained unchanged ( figure 2 ) .\na blt1 antagonist increased c5a - dependent chemotaxis in both wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils ( figure 2 ) , possibly by blocking cross - desensitization between the chemoattractant receptors .\nthe relative difference in chemotaxis was undiminished following treatment with the blt1 antagonist : 2.8-fold higher in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils compared to wild - type ( figure 2 ) .\noverall , the data suggest that the increase in c5a - dependent chemotaxis in knockout neutrophils is unrelated to ltb4 , other eicosanoids , or receptor cross - desensitization .\nan alternative possibility is that cyp4f18 metabolizes a novel lipid substrate involved in the downstream signaling pathways and relay systems that mediate c5a activity ( c5a is a polypeptide and therefore not a cyp substrate ) .\ncyps typically have broad and overlapping substrate specificity , and redundancy of function is a consistent problem with cyp knockout studies .\nit is often difficult to observe a phenotype for deletion of one cyp in vivo , because of the effects of multiple related cyps in complex tissue environments .\nthere are advantages to studying cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils in vitro , because cyp4f18 is the only cyp4 transcript expressed at high levels in these cells ( figure 3 ) .\nanother problem with cyp knockout studies is that deletion of one cyp sometimes leads to up- or downregulation of a different cyp that generates an observed phenotype .\nfor example , knockout of cyp4a14 led to male - specific hypertension that was caused by upregulation of cyp4a12 .\nwe compared expression of all members of the cyp4 family in wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils and detected no differences other than loss of cyp4f18 in the knockout ( figure 3 ) .\nwe used a mouse model of dss colitis for a preliminary investigation of the consequences of altered c5a chemotaxis in vivo .\na c5a receptor antagonist ameliorates pathology in this model , and genetic association studies link variants of the cyp4f2 and cyp4f3 genes with celiac disease in humans .\nmice were treated continuously with 4% dss for 9 days , but the profile of weight loss , disease activity , and colonic tissue mpo was not significantly different in wild - type and cyp4f18 knockout mice ( figures 4 and 5 ) .\nselection and design of future in vivo strategies will benefit from more in vitro information about cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils .\na comparison of lipid metabolism in wild - type and knockout neutrophils will help to determine if novel cyp4f18 substrates are relevant to c5a chemotaxis and might point to other activities affected by loss of cyp4f18 .\ncyp4f enzymes have the ability to catalyze oxidation of a diverse range of lipid substrates related to inflammation .\na significant challenge is to identify physiologically relevant substrates among multiple possibilities and to assign functions to individual cyps .\nknockout studies are problematic because of the ability of related cyps to compensate for function or to change expression and lead to phenotypes that are unrelated to the deleted cyp .\nneutrophils provide a useful tool for our studies of cyp4f18 knockout mice : cyp4f18 is the only cyp4 enzyme expressed at high levels in these cells , and other cyp4 enzymes do not change expression in cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils . in this report\nwe demonstrate that there is no difference in ltb4-dependent chemotaxis of mouse neutrophils that lack cyp4f18 , despite the high activity of cyp4f18 for ltb4 as a substrate .\nthis is significant , because many studies assume that cyp4fs regulate ltb4 function based on known activity as ltb4 hydroxylases .\nwe identified an unexpected role for cyp4f18 in regulating c5a - dependent neutrophil chemotaxis , and this was independent of ltb4 .\nfurther studies of cyp4f18 knockout neutrophils in vitro will inform the design of in vivo strategies to investigate immune regulation .","abstract":" cyp4fs were first identified as enzymes that catalyze hydroxylation of leukotriene b4 ( ltb4 ) . \n cyp4f18 has an unusual expression in neutrophils and was predicted to play a role in regulating ltb4-dependent inflammation . \n we compared chemotaxis of wild -

{"article":"modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) or intensity - modulated arc therapy ( imat ) can provide better dose distribution for planning the target volume and sparing normal tissue [ 1 , 2 ] .\nhowever , these techniques require dosimetric quality assurance in every patient ( patient - specific quality assurance : sqa ) before treatment because of the very complex radiation delivery procedures required . according to the japanese guidelines\n, sqa is divided into two categories [ 38 ] : absolute dose measurement and dose distribution validation . in general ,\nan ionization chamber is used for absolute dose measurement , whereas film is a standard dosimetric tool for validating dose distribution .\nradiographic films based on the silver halide reaction have been widely used for validation of the relative dose distribution in imrt phantom plans .\nhowever , the film processors are becoming obsolete because digital imaging technology now predominates in many hospitals .\ntherefore , radiochromic films have recently been marketed as self - developing films that do not require a processor .\nthese films have spatial resolution as high as radiographic films , are nearly tissue - equivalent , and have a well - defined dose response ; they can accordingly be used to accurately measure relative dose distributions .\nmany investigators have reported the characteristics of radiochromic films and the scanning procedures for their use in therapeutic photon beam dosimetry .\nin particular , it is important to avoid systematic artifacts and dose uncertainty during the scanning procedure [ 913 ] .\nthe gafchromic ebt2 ( ebt2 , isp ( wayne , nj , usa ) ) film is a transmission - type radiochromic film consisting of four layers , including a polyester substrate base .\nmost users of ebt2 films measure the optical density of the film with a single channel acquisition ( sca ) technique .\nsca is the standard technique for measuring the film optical density using a color flatbed scanner . with this method\none chooses a specific color range within the visible light spectrum transmitted through the film ; we normally use red because it best suits the characteristics of ebt2 film . on the other hand ,\nthe triple channel correction acquisition ( tcca ) technique is a model - based method for obtaining the characteristic curve of ebt2 film .\nthe algorithm and fundamental characteristics of this method have already been reported by micke et al . .\ntcca has the benefit of separating the dose - dependent and dose - independent parts of the scanned signals , to compensate for a variety of anomalies , artifacts and other disturbances such as variations of film thickness ( e.g. active layer thickness ) , scanner non - linearity and process noise , and to allow entire available sensitivity range of the film to be used . in this study , we compared tcca with sca in performing ebt2 film dosimetry for imrt and imat .\nthis study was composed of two parts : a fundamental evaluation and a clinical evaluation .\na clinac ix medical linear accelerator ( varian medical systems , palo alto , ca , usa ) and a novalis tx medical linear accelerator ( brainlab , feldkirchen , germany ) were used in this study . for the fundamental evaluation ,\nan entire sheet of ebt2 film ( 10 inch    12 inch ( 25.4 cm    30.48 cm ) ) was divided into a 3    4 grid of 6    6 cm pieces in the central part of the sheet .\neach film piece was inserted into a 30    30    30 cm solid -

steps ( including five batches ) were then obtained by tcca and sca .\nwe calibrated the monitor chamber of the linear accelerator according to the japanese standard measurement protocol before acquisition of the first calibration curve .\nafter this process , we obtained all calibration curves under the same conditions , and curves were compared to evaluate their consistency .\nwith tcca , the calibration curves were created using filmqapro 2010 software ( version 0 ; isp co. ltd , wayne , nj , usa ) .\nthe data were then exported in american standard code for information interchange ( ascii ) format using an in -

ebt ( ebt ) film among four theoretical models .\nhe concluded that the gamma - distributed single - hit model based on the percolation theory was suitable for fitting and smoothing of the calibration curve of ebt film .\nhowever , this algorithm is not able to account for density differences due to film thickness variation and\/or scanner - dependent variation .\nin addition , the accuracy of this method was better in the dose range from 0 to 2 gy in radiochromic dosimetry , it is necessary to characterize the average relationship between the dose to which the film is exposed and the response of film .\ntcca can ensure the average value of the dose to which ebt2 films are exposed by means of a mathematical equation .\nhence , when creating a calibration table , tcca appears to have an advantage in obtaining the average relationship between the dose to which the film is exposed and the film response . in radiochromic film dosimetry\nreported the absolute non - uniformity correction method for radiochromic film dosimetry using a flatbed scanner .\nthey estimated the total 2-sigma dose uncertainty at within 4% for doses between 1 and 3 gy and reaching a minimum at approximately 2 gy .\ntheir method might consequently reduce uncertainty and disturbance due to the film scanner ; however , it is limited to portrait orientation during scanning .\nreported the overall accuracy of ebt film absolute dosimetry in water . according to their evaluation ,\nthe overall random uncertainty in absolute dose with ebt film was in the order of 1.8% ( 1 sd ) .\nthis result was obtained by scanning a limited area of film , and they recommended that a similar customized protocol for scanning of radiochromic film is important to avoid systematic artifacts .\nmasi et al . reported a comparative study of different dosimetric tools in sqa for volumetric arc therapy .\ntheir results ( pass rate ) showed that ebt2 film had the highest associated uncertainty when compared with several other tools .\nhowever , they used ebt2 film with the ebt film protocol , and considered that the large difference ( uncertainty ) might have been caused by an inappropriate scanning protocol for ebt2 film .\nwe previously established a customized protocol for scanning ebt2 film to reduce systematic uncertainty [ 13 , 14 ] , the details of which are given in table  1 .\nfurthermore , this protocol is compatible with tcca , allowing the overall accuracy of ebt2 film dosimetry to be improved further .\nin sqa for imrt or other complex technologies , the composite validation of dose distributions is required to evaluate the doses both in the prescribed dose range and for organs at risk .\ninconsistency between the calibration curves might make it difficult to match the dose distribution in both dose ranges .\nin particular , if we normalize the dose distribution indicated by film so that it falls within the prescribed dose range , the dose difference from the organs - at - risk range might be unacceptable for sqa .\ntcca allows us to avoid significant dose difference due to non - uniformity of films in a low dose range because this method can accurately obtain the average film response even at such dose ranges .\nwe therefore believe tcca is suitable for ebt2 film dosimetry to perform dose validation when the distribution has a high - gradient region , such as in imrt or rapidarc deliveries . on the other hand , we suggest that those performing radiochromic dosimetry with tcca should ensure that they evaluate slight differences such as those due to mlc leakage and the tongue and groove ( t&g ) effect . in particular , the t&g effect is noteworthy in terms of imrt dose distribution , and can generally be measured using film .\nthe total transmission factor for the t&g effect ( ttg ) consists of the product of the transmission factors of tongue ( tt ) and groove ( tg ) structures ( eq .\nif tt is equal to tg , it is assumed that the tongue and groove are of equal thickness . by considering the transmission factors separately for t&g structures , the t&g effects on the dose distribution will be correctly included in the process of dose calculation .\ntcca requires a considerable area for smoothing ( at least 2.5    2.5  cm in 150 dpi ) , and if the area incorporating the t&g effect is much smaller than this large region in each color channel , the t&g effect will be sometimes ignored because of smoothing by tcca .\nhence the density difference due to t&g can not be corrected accurately for this large a region . in sqa ,\nthe dose comparison in the coronal plane includes a t&g evaluation . however , if the dose distribution has a high - gradient area in a small region , the slight density deviation due to t&g will be ignored as a noise area with tcca\nwe showed that calibration curves obtained by tcca have better consistency than those produced by sca , particularly in the low - dose range . in the clinical evaluation\n, the potential advantage of the tcca method was observed in high - dose gradient regions in clinically relevant imrt and rapidarc cases .\nhence , ebt2 film dosimetry in combination with tcca could be useful in clinical practices such as sqa .\nit is noteworthy , however , that the correct handling procedure for ebt2 films is important to achieve accurate sqa results , even if tcca is used .\nin addition , the characteristics of tcca mean that this method sometimes ignores small deviations such as leaf transmission .\nwe conclude that while tcca is useful for sqa , physicists should consider both its merits and demerits carefully .","abstract":" the purpose of this study was to evaluate the triple channel correction acquisition ( tcca ) method for radiochromic film dosimetry performed with a flatbed scanner . \n the study had two parts : a fundamental and a clinical examination . in the fundamental examination \n , we evaluated the accuracy of calibration curves for gafchromic ebt2 ( ebt2 ) . \n the films were calibrated using a field -

{"article":"werlhof s disease or morbus maculosus haemorrhagicus was described by paul gottfried werlhof in 1753.1 this is likely to be the same condition mentioned in 1557 as  morbus pulicaris absque febre  by amatus lusitanus in his curationum medicinalium centuriae quatuor.2 the description by lusitanus of dark spots without fever is likely to have been a manifestation of immune thrombocytopenia ( itp).3 in 1658 , riverius postulated that the dark spots were due to  thinness of the blood . \nthe intervening years led to the discovery of blood granules that were later termed platelets . with the description of platelets by bizzozero in 1882,4 it was then possible to associate number of platelets with itp . in 1887 , denys5 observed that the platelet number dropped during the episode of purpura and that there was an increase in platelet count after the hemorrhagic episode . why were platelets low in itp ?\nas documented by bedson,6 the first antiplatelet sera was described by mf marino in 1905 .\na decade later , in 1915 , jcg ledingham showed that anti - guinea pig platelet serum was noxious to guinea pigs and produced a condition analogous to itp in humans . the well - known harrington \nhollingsworth experiment clearly demonstrated that a factor in plasma was able to significantly reduce platelet number in healthy subjects transfused with plasma from itp patients.7 this evidence appeared to demonstrate that accelerated platelet destruction was the key initiating event in itp .\nthese platelet - damaging factors in plasma are immunoglobulins that recognize abundant platelet receptors such as gpiib \/ iiia and gpib \/ ix .\nseveral studies have shown that a large proportion of itp patients have both platelet - associated and circulating antiplatelet autoantibodies.810 the coating of platelets by antiplatelet autoantibodies then leads to fc receptor - mediated phagocytosis.11 there is evidence for additional mechanisms that may cause a reduction in circulating platelets .\nfor instance , destruction of autologous platelets by cytotoxic t - lymphocytes has been observed in chronic itp patients.12,13 lately , a new mechanism was described that may account , at least in part , for platelet destruction in itp .\nthe loss of sialic acid moieties from platelet glycoproteins ( termed desialylation ) due to autoantibody activity increases platelet destruction by liver cells.14,15 thus , several mechanisms are responsible for platelet destruction in itp .\nhowever , as will be discussed ( and crucially for the mechanism of action of thrombopoietin receptor agonist [ tpo - ras ] ) , platelet destruction is only a partial explanation , and a reduction in platelet production by megakaryocytes is fundamental for the pathogenesis of itp .\nin 1890 , soon after bizzozero s description of the platelet , howell16 described the megakaryocyte and sometime later in 1906 wright17 proposed that these cells were the source of platelets . in the 1940s , it was shown that patients with itp had normal ( or slightly increased ) megakaryocyte numbers , but crucially a large proportion of these cells did not form platelets.18 this suggests that the observed reduction in platelet number is also a consequence of insufficient production .\nit is now clear that antiplatelet autoantibodies interact with glycoproteins on megakaryocytes.1921 the consequence of this interaction is detrimental to megakaryocytic progenitor cells22 and , as will be described , also to mature megakaryocytes.21,2325 observations in culture have indicated that itp autoantibodies have a negative impact on megakaryocyte differentiation , polyploidization , and proliferation.26,27 more recently , it was shown that antiplatelet autoantibodies from drug - induced itp inhibited megakaryocyte maturation , proliferation , and proplatelet formation.21 iraqi et al23 demonstrated that the treatment of cord blood - derived mature megakaryocytes with igg purified from itp plasma inhibited proplatelet formation and platelet release in culture .\nboth inhibition of proplatelet formation and a reduction in proplatelet complexity have also been observed after treatment of megakaryocytes with anti - gpiib \/ iiia antibodies isolated from itp patients.24 together these studies indicate that antiplatelet autoantibodies interact with megakaryocytes and suppress platelet production .\ntreatment of itp is initiated if the platelet count is under 3010\/l or if signs of bleeding are present . depending on other factors ( comorbidities , risk of bleeding ) , a platelet count of < 5010\/l\nmay warrant intervention.28 the aim of the intervention is to reduce the likelihood of bleeding by maintaining an adequate platelet level .\ncorticosteroids ( prednisone , dexamethasone ) are the first line of therapy28 and act by reducing phagocytosis and by decreasing autoantibody production .\nother first - line options are intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) and anti - d .\nthe effectiveness of ivig and anti - d in itp relate to the suppression of platelet destruction .\nivig may decrease platelet destruction via the inhibition of fc receptors and by exerting a suppressive effect on the production of autoantibodies by b - cells .\nivig may also compete with and promote the clearance of the autoantibody.29 these first - line treatments do not provide a permanent platelet response in most patients .\nthe second line of itp therapy includes cyclosporine a , rituximab , splenectomy , and tpo receptor agonists.30 the depletion of b cells with anti - cd20 antibody ( rituximab ) is effective in itp . the initial study by cooper et al31 demonstrated a response in 54% of subjects and a lasting response in 32% .\nan analysis of 72 adults and 66 children who responded to standard rituximab administration found that 26% of patients achieved treatment - free response after 5 years.32 recently , a new triple therapy given over 4 weeks was developed in our hospital.33 this intervention consists of high - dose dexamethasone , cyclosporine a , and low - dose rituximab .\nthe trial resulted in relapse - free survival of 76% after 2 years.33 this indicates that by using current drugs a lasting remission might be attainable in a large percentage of cases and merits further investigation .\nthe hypothesis was that itp was caused by excessive destruction of platelets by the spleen .\nthe first splenectomy performed in an itp patient was successful and resulted in a rapid increase in platelet number and resolution of the purpura.3 this established the use of splenectomy as the therapy of choice for cases of severe itp and it remained as the sole therapeutic choice until the 1950s ( a second therapeutic option only became available in the middle of the 20th century with the introduction of corticosteroids ) . to date , splenectomy remains a central option for adults that do not respond to steroid treatment.34 it should be noted that splenectomy is an effective treatment and is the only intervention that leads to a complete response in a large number of patients.35 a systematic review of the literature ( 2,623 adults ) found that there was a stable complete response in two thirds of itp patients34 ( median follow - up 28 months ) .\nmikhael et al,36 who reviewed 23 studies conducted between 1991 and 2008 , reached a similar conclusion .\nthey reported a failure rate in 28% of cases 5 years after splenectomy.36 there are complications associated with the procedure , including the possibility of postoperative bleeding , sepsis , and thrombosis .\nfactors that affect decision - making include impact of itp in the patient s life , personal opinion of the likely success of the intervention , and consideration of splenectomy as a treatment of last resort.37 there may also be some reluctance to splenectomy by practitioners given that it is an invasive procedure that does not eliminate the possibility of relapse.38 it has been proposed that splenectomy could be delayed for up to 3 years due to the increased likelihood of remission in that period.39 moreover , removal of the organ causes loss of functions such as antibody production and effective elimination of nonfunctional blood cells .\nin fact , the rate of splenectomy as a treatment for itp appears to be in decline.40\nthe rebound in platelet levels following thrombocytopenia was ascribed to a substance termed thrombopoietin ( tpo or thpo ) in the 1950s ( see review by kaushansky41 ) . isolation and eventual cloning of tpo\nwas a demanding undertaking and took decades to accomplish . cloning and biological evaluation of murine tpo in 199442\nwas followed by the demonstration that tpo sustained megakaryocyte colony formation and promoted differentiation and polyploidization both in vitro and in vivo.43 tpo activity is mediated via activation of its receptor , c - mpl .\nthe cloning and characterization of tpo led immediately to proposals regarding its potential therapeutic use .\nthe first recombinant preparations to be evaluated were human thrombopoietin ( rhtpo ) and pegylated human megakaryocyte growth and development factor ( peg - rhmgdf ) .\nthe former was the full - length protein produced in mammalian cell culture and the latter was expressed in bacteria and contained the tpo receptor binding domain ( these compounds are now called first - generation tpo - ras ) .\nthese agents were promising in their capacity to increase platelet counts in conditions such as itp,44 myelodysplastic syndrome,45 cancer,46,47 and hiv - associated thrombocytopenia.45 the observation of severe thrombocytopenia in some subjects treated with peg - rhmgdf ended the clinical application of the first generation of tpo - ras .\nthe drop in platelet counts was caused by the development of antibodies against peg - rhmgdf that cross - reacted with and neutralized endogenous human tpo.48 to circumvent potential detrimental immune reactions , efforts were directed toward the development of molecules structurally unrelated to tpo .\nseveral tpo - ras underwent development and two of these , romiplostim and eltrombopag , were approved for clinical use in 2008.49,50 here , we will look specifically at studies using romiplostim .\nromiplostim is a peptibody consisting of four c - mpl binding peptides ( 14 amino acids long ) linked to two fc domains of igg1 .\nthe peptide has no sequence homology to tpo but competes for binding to its receptor.51 engagement of romiplostim with c - mpl leads to receptor activation , intracellular signaling , and increased platelet production.52 the lack of sequence homology suggests that if anti - romiplostim antibodies were developed , these would not interact with and neutralize endogenous tpo . indeed , a study of 225 itp patients treated with romiplostim found that 11% developed anti - romiplostim antibodies , but only one patient had neutralizing antibodies.53 importantly , none of these antibodies cross - reacted with endogenous tpo.53 of note , 17 out of 225 patients investigated had preexisting anti - romiplostim antibodies , but this did not affect the activity of the drug .\nthe effectiveness of romiplostim ( also known as amg 531 , amp-2 , or nplate , amgen inc . , thousand oaks , ca , usa ) as a potential therapy for itp was first shown in a dose - finding clinical trial.54 amg 531 was found to be effective in increasing platelet counts in itp patients and did not produce significant adverse side effects.54 in this study , most patients ( 79% in phase i and 67% in phase\nii ) had undergone splenectomy,54 but the response data were not collated based on this criterion .\na study by kuter et al55 examined the activity of romiplostim in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized itp patients .\nthe durable platelet response ( defined as a platelet count of 5010\/l during at least 6 of the last 8 weeks of treatment ) was more pronounced in nonsplenectomized patients ( 56% ) versus 38% in the splenectomized cohort.55 the overall response ( both transient and durable ) was 88% and 79% for nonsplenectomized and splenectomized patients , respectively .\non the other hand , a japanese phase iii trial of 10 splenectomized and 12 nonsplenectomized itp patients found no differential effect on weekly platelet response.56 even though treatment with tpo - ra requires ongoing drug administration and is not a single intervention like splenectomy , the potential adverse effects of splenectomy would argue against its preferential use as a second line of therapy .\nthe adverse effects of romiplostim include headaches , fatigue , and nasopharyngitis , while for splenectomy adverse outcomes may include hemorrhage , infection , sepsis , and , in rare cases , death.30 so far , the adverse effects of prolonged romiplostim use seem minor .\nan analysis of over 1,000 patients receiving romiplostim for a mean of 76 weeks found no increase in adverse effects including thrombosis , bone marrow reticulin , or malignancy.57 the fact that no increase in thrombosis was reported is important since itp , despite low platelet counts , could be considered to be a prothrombotic condition.58 in fact , splenectomy would be more concerning in this case since it is associated with an increase in thrombotic events.59 analysis of 13 clinical trials ( 653 patients ) treated with romiplostim for extended periods ( up to 5 years ) found that the treatment was tolerated and there were no salient safety concerns in terms of hematopoietic malignancies , bone marrow reticulin or thrombotic events.60 a study of 234 nonsplenectomized patients receiving either romiplostim or standard of care reported better platelet response , improved quality of life , and lower rates of splenctomy ( 9% versus 36% ) in patients receiving romoplostim.61 it should be noted , however , that a meta - analysis of 15 studies with 3026 thrombocytopenic patients concluded that there was an increased risk of thromboembolism in patients treated with tpo - ras relative to controls ( frequency 3.69% versus 1.46% , respectively).62 however , the statistical significance was principally obtained from non - itp thrombocytopenic patients such as those with chronic liver disease .\nthis study lends some support to the european guidelines , which allow romiplostim treatment in nonsplenectomized patients only if splenectomy is not an option.63 the guidelines recommend the use of romiplostim in splenectomized patients if they are refractory to standard treatments .\nthe american society of hematology ( ash ) guidelines regard splenectomy as an intervention that achieves remission in most patients .\ntherefore , the ash guidelines would consider splenectomy as an option following failure of corticosteroid therapy.64 the international consensus group , on the other hand , gives equal consideration to splenectomy as to other second - line treatments such as rituximab , cyclosporine a , and tpo - ras.30 splenectomy remains the only option for patients that are refractory to both first- and second - line therapies , but the procedure is advisable only if satisfactory platelet counts are not obtained for some time.28\nrefractoriness refers to the proportion of itp patients that does not respond to treatment . in the case of splenectomized patients\n, it refers to persistent low platelet counts and the requirement for additional therapy to maintain adequate levels.65 why would refractory patients respond to tpo - ras ?\nthe dual nature of itp , ie , increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production , suggests that if platelet production is sufficiently suppressed , then interventions that prevent platelet destruction , such as corticosteroids , ivig , rituximab , and splenectomy , would not be adequate to overcome the platelet deficit .\ntherefore , only patients with higher levels of platelet production would be expected to be more responsive to inhibition of platelet destruction .\ntpo - ras are the only option that deals with suboptimal platelet production and are likely to benefit preferentially patients with impaired platelet formation .\nthe fact that splenectomized patients responded well to romiplostim treatment55,56 indicates that lack of platelet production was a major underlying cause in responders .\ndual therapy with ivig and romiplostim in patients unresponsive to either therapy has been successfully used to raise the platelet levels prior to splenectomy.66 it is likely that in these patients splenic platelet destruction was severe and could not be overcome by the activity of romiplostim alone .\nan unexpected benefit of tpo - ra administration is the sustained remission achieved by certain patients after cessation of therapy.67,68 remission seems to be independent of splenectomy status , sex , or age.65 a potential mechanism is the restoration of immune tolerance by tregs.69 why are not all itp patients responsive to tpo - ras ?\nnonresponsiveness to tpo - ras may be due to intrinsic properties of the antiplatelet autoantibodies .\nit is clear that the known activity of tpo - ras ( ie , induction of megakaryopoiesis ) still occurs in nonresponders , but platelet release is somehow blocked by the effect of the autoantibody.70 there might be several reasons for deficient platelet release by megakaryocytes , for instance , defective signaling pathways or mutations ; however , it appears that the activity of different classes of autoantibodies , such as anti - gpib \/ ix antibodies , might prevent platelet release.25 experimental evidence using cultured megakaryocytes indicates that , in the presence of itp autoantibodies , tpo - ras are capable of increasing the proportion of megakaryocytes producing proplatelets from an existing population.23 this implies that there is an additional mechanism in which tpo - ras operate on mature megakaryocytes , overcome the harmful activity of the antiplatelet antibody , and promote proplatelet formation .\nimportantly , tpo - ras were not effective in the presence of some of the autoantibodies tested,23 suggesting that the nature of the autoantibody ( specificity , binding site , affinity ) is a substantial determinant of the outcome . future work will substantiate this proposed property of tpo - ras .\nfor itp patients refractory to other treatments , splenectomy remains the only therapy that provides the prospect of complete remission .\nthe development of romiplostim has seen the addition of a platelet - boosting drug to the treatment of itp .\nromiplostim administration generates a stable platelet response in a majority of patients without significant adverse effects and results in a reduced number of patients undergoing splenectomy .\nongoing observation is required to establish its safety and effectiveness after long - term use .","abstract":" romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist ( tpo - ra ) used for the treatment of adult primary immune thrombocytopenia ( itp ) . \n itp is an autoimmune condition characterized by low platelet counts due to increased destruction and reduced platelet production . \n first -

It is reported that almost 1 in 10 patients with coronary artery disease seen by interventional cardiologists have a cardiac anomaly associated with their coronary lesion.1 ) Coronary artery fistulas may be the most common and potentially severe cardiac anomaly; however, coronary artery anomalies are generally associated with normal cardiac function and asymptomatic disease.7,8) Coronary artery fistulas are rare, accounting for 0.2% of congenital heart defects.9) Anomalous origin of the coronary artery is thought to be the most common cause of coronary artery fistula.\nCoronary artery fistulas present a diagnostic and management challenge because the anomalous channel is difficult to access with the usual diagnostic tools and treatment carries a high risk of adverse events. Furthermore, these fistulas may or may not have direct communication with systemic or pulmonary arteries, complicating evaluation for the existence of collateral systems.10)\nThis report describes the case of a patient with a coronary fistula from the coronary artery to the ascending aorta with the fistula directly communicating with the arch. The patient had not had any symptoms associated with the congenital anomaly; however, it was difficult to diagnose and monitor the course of the fistula because conventional diagnostic imaging tools were not effective to detect the direct communication between the ascending aorta and the coronary fistula. We describe the use of a 3D echocardiography for the precise diagnosis of coronary artery fistula in the presence of a cardiac mass.\nCase report\nA 46-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of dyspnea on exertion. He was healthy with no cardiac symptoms and had no history of heart disease. The vital signs were systolic blood pressure 137mmHg and a heart rate of 105 beats\/min.

eight percent of all aes in the trial were reported as mild or moderate in severity ( versus only 2% reported as severe ) and 79% of events had resolved at 18 months .\nmost of the related events were transient side effects of therapy and resolved either spontaneously with no intervention or with an alteration of the therapy algorithm .\none patient had a gastric perforation at the gastroesophageal junction during explant of the device following the participant 's decision to discontinue in the study .\ntable 4 shows the serious adverse events ( saes ) that occurred through 18 months classified according to the clavien -

invasive options\nwhile longer - term efficacy data are needed , the continued durability of weight loss with vbloc through 18 months provides additional support that vagal block may be considered an effective alternative to conventional weight loss surgery .\nweight loss in the sham group was thought to result from a combination of sham surgery including a sham device , self - monitoring due to daily interaction with the sham device to recharge the battery , and the weight management program .\nweight loss in the sham group was more than expected , since participants were not prescribed a diet ( e.g. , portion - controlled meals ) or physical activity , and as such , the primary 12-month objectives of the trial were not met .\nsham surgeries in other contexts have also produced large effects [ 911 ] , but these effects would be expected to be transient since no active treatment is being delivered . surprisingly , weight loss in the sham group of the recharge trial was relatively stable between 6 months and 12 months but deteriorated considerably thereafter .\nwe suspect that this prolonged sham effect may have resulted from enhanced self - monitoring due to the daily interaction with the sham device .\nstatistical modeling of the 18 month results suggest that unblinding of participants did not have a significant impact on the weight trajectories of either group and that weight regain in the sham group occurred regardless of whether or not participants remained blinded .\nthis 50% relative increase in the treatment effect of vbloc therapy through 18 months compared to 12 months indicates more substantial efficacy than that previously reported with vbloc compared to a rigorous sham control .\nhowever , nearly 80% of randomized participants in both groups had a visit within 2 months of the 18-month time point and all analyses were conducted on the itt sample using all available longitudinal data , so inference can be made to the entire cohort at 18 months .\nthis limitation is offset by the continued analysis of the itt cohort rather than a convenience sample as well as sensitivity analyses that concurred with the overall analysis .\nfinally , all participants were not blinded through 18 months and were unblinded on a rolling basis , making interpretation more difficult .\nhowever , nearly 90% of participants were still blinded through the 15-month visit , at which point much of the weight regain in the sham group had already taken place .\nadditional analyses also suggest that unblinding did not impact weight regain in the sham group .\nfollow - up through 18 months of the recharge study showed sustained weight loss with intermittent vagal nerve block but not with a sham surgery and device intervention .\nadditional long - term data and continued follow -

term prognosis .\nresidents of the worcester ( ma ) metropolitan area discharged from all greater worcester medical centers after an episode of documented acute hf in 1995 and 2000 as part of the worcester heart failure study comprised the population of this report.9,10\nadult male and female residents of all ages from the worcester ( ma ) metropolitan area ( 2000 census estimate = 478,000 ) hospitalized for possible acute hf at all eleven greater worcester medical centers during 1995 and 2000 comprised the study population . for purposes of identifying the study population ,\nthe medical records of patients with primary or secondary international classification of diseases , ninth revision ( icd-9 ) codes consistent with the possible presence of hf were reviewed in a standardized manner.9,10 patients with a discharge diagnosis of hf ( icd-9 code 428 ) comprised the primary diagnostic rubric reviewed for the identification of cases of possible hf .\nin addition , the medical records of patients with discharge diagnoses of rheumatic hf ( icd-9 code 398.9 ) , hypertensive heart and renal disease ( icd-9 codes 402 and 404 , respectively ) , acute cor pulmonale ( icd-9 code 415 ) , other diseases of the endocardium ( icd-9 code 424 ) , cardiomyopathy ( icd-9 code 425.4 ) , pulmonary heart disease and congestion ( icd-9 codes 416.9 and 514 , respectively ) , acute lung edema ( icd-9 code 518.4 ) , edema ( icd-9 code 782.3 ) , and dyspnea and respiratory abnormalities ( icd-9 code 786 ) were reviewed by trained study physicians and nurses to identify patients who may have had newly diagnosed acute hf . the diagnosis of acute hf in greater worcester residents presenting to area hospitals with signs and symptoms of hf was defined as the presence of decompensated hf based on use of the framingham study criteria.11 these criteria included the presence of two major criteria ( eg , rales and distended neck veins ) or one major and two minor ( eg , night cough and dyspnea on ordinary exertion ) criteria .\nan incident ( first ) event of acute hf was defined as the absence of a prior hospitalization for hf , physician diagnosis of hf , or past treatment for hf based on the review of data contained in hospital medical records .\npatients who developed hf secondary to admission for another acute illness ( eg , acute myocardial infarction ) or after a procedure or surgery ( eg , percutaneous coronary intervention ) were not included .\npatients who died during the index hospitalization were excluded from the final analytic sample , since the aim was to describe the long - term prognosis of discharged hospital patients .\ninformation was collected about patient s demographic , medical history , and clinical characteristics , as well as laboratory test results , through the review of information contained in hospital medical records .\nthis included information about a patient s age , sex , race \/ ethnicity , body mass index ( bmi ) , initial symptoms of hf , physical examination findings , clinical characteristics , prior comorbidities ( eg , stroke , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ) , and laboratory findings ( eg , serum levels of glucose , hematocrit , estimated glomerular filtration rate [ egfr]).12 since ejection fraction findings during the index hospitalization were available for only one - third of hospital survivors of decompensated hf in the present study , this variable was not used in the analysis of factors associated with long - term prognosis after acute hf .\nphysicians progress notes and daily medication logs were reviewed for the prescribing of selected medications .\nthe use of cardiac medications that have been shown to be of benefit in improving the prognosis of patients with hf ( -blockers , angiotensin receptor blockers , and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors ) , as well as the use of medications shown to be effective in relieving the symptoms of patients with acute hf ( digoxin and diuretics ) were examined.13 information about patients long - term survival status was obtained through the review of hospital medical records at all participating medical centers for subsequent hospitalizations or medical care contacts , as well as through the review of the social security death index and statewide death certificates .\na life - table approach was used to examine long - term mortality patterns after greater worcester residents were discharged from all metropolitan worcester medical centers after a first episode of acute hf or a new exacerbation of previously diagnosed hf in 1995 and 2000 through the end of 2008 , including patients with varying lengths of long - term follow - up .\nlong - term all - cause post - hospital - discharge death rates were calculated in a standard manner with accompanying 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) .\ndifferences in the distribution of selected demographic and clinical characteristics between post - discharge decedents and survivors were examined using chi - square tests and t - tests for discrete and continuous variables , respectively .\ndifferences in the long - term prognosis of patients discharged from all greater worcester hospitals after acute hf at selected post - discharge time points were examined through the use of chi - square tests and the log - rank test for statistical significance . a logistic regression approach was used to identify demographic , medical history , laboratory , and clinical factors associated with a poor prognosis after hf at 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge , given the high risk of dying at these time points .\nmultivariable adjusted odds ratios ( ors ) and accompanying 95% cis of factors associated with a poor prognosis at 3 months and at 1 year after hospital discharge were calculated in a standard manner .\nthese periods were chosen for analysis due to the high death rates experienced by patients with acute hf during the first several months to 1 year after hospital discharge for hf .\nsince further information was not available about changes in patients clinical or treatment statuses after being discharged from greater worcester medical centers during the years under study , the identification of factors associated with a poor prognosis was focused on those that could be identified at the time of hospital discharge for hf and that may be amenable to change .\nthe use of various hospital therapies were not controlled for in these multivariable adjusted regression analyses , due to the nonrandomized observational nature of the present noncurrent prospective study and potential for confounding by treatment indication .\nfurther , treatment variables were not included in the multivariable adjusted regression models due to the difficulty in interpretation of any resultant findings .\nafter an extensive review of hospital medical records and various disease diagnostic rubrics in which cases of possible hf might be found , a total of 1949 greater worcester residents were hospitalized for acute hf in the year 1995 and 2587 in the year 2000 ; of these , there were a total of 508 incident ( initial episode ) events of acute hf in 1995 and 645 cases of newly diagnosed acute hf in 2000 . in 1995 , 8.5% of all cases of acute hf died during their index hospitalization compared with 5.5% of all patients with acute hf in 2000 ; among incident cases of acute hf , 7.9% died in 1995 , whereas 5.7% died in 2000 . after excluding patients who died during their index hospitalization , in order to systematically characterize the post - discharge prognosis of patients with acute hf , the final analytic sample consisted of 1783 hospital survivors in 1995 and 2445 patients in 2000 ; of these ,\nthe average age of the study population was 76 years , 57% were women , and approximately three - quarters had been previously diagnosed with hf based on a review of the information contained in hospital medical records .\nthere were no appreciable differences in the average age ( 75 years versus 76 years ) , proportion of women ( 58% versus 57% ) , or percentage of patients presenting with a first episode of hf ( 26% versus 25% ) between hospital survivors of hf in 1995 as compared with those discharged in 2000 , respectively . in examining the long - term prognosis for all patients discharged after a confirmed episode of acute hf , the 3-month , 1-year , and 5-year death rates were 18.8% ( 95% ci 17.6%20.0% ) , 39.7% ( 95% ci 38.2%41.2% ) , and 82.9% ( 95% ci 81.7%84.0% ) , respectively .\npatients discharged from all greater worcester medical centers in 2000 after hospitalization for decompensated hf experienced slightly lower all - cause death rates than patients discharged in 1995 at each of the time points examined , namely 3 months , 1 year , and 5 years ( table 1 ) .\nwhen post - discharge death rates in persons with an incident ( first ) documented episode of acute hf were examined , patients discharged from all greater worcester hospitals in 2000 also experienced slightly lower post - discharge death rates at 3 months , 1 year , and at 5 years compared with patients discharged in 1995 ( table 1 ) .\na series of multiple regression analyses were carried out for purposes of determining whether the long - term prognosis after hf has changed during the years under study after controlling for a number of factors of prognostic importance . after controlling for age , sex , medical history of several comorbid conditions , acute symptoms , and laboratory findings in these regression analyses ,\npatients discharged from all greater worcester hospitals in 2000 , as compared with those discharged in 1995 , were at considerably lower risk of dying at 3 months ( or = 0.85 , 95% ci 0.731.00 ) and at 1 year ( or = 0.81 , 95% ci = 0.710.92 ) . given the high death rates experienced by hospital survivors of acute hf during the first year after being discharged from the hospital after acute decompensated hf , the demographic and clinical characteristics of post - discharge decedents were compared with survivors at 3 months and at 1 year ( table 2 ) .\noverall , patients who died during the first 3 months after hospital discharge were generally older , had a lower bmi , and were more likely to have been previously diagnosed with anemia , chronic kidney disease , stroke , and hf than survivors of this high - risk period ( table 2 ) .\npatients who died during the first 3 months following hospital discharge were more likely to present with weakness at the time of their index hospitalization than post - discharge survivors .\npatients dying during the first 3 months after hospital discharge had markedly lower blood pressure findings than patients who survived this period .\npost - discharge decedents were less likely to have been prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors \/ angiotensin receptor blockers , aspirin , beta blockers , and digoxin than patients who survived the initial 3 months or 1 year after hospital discharge .\nrelatively similar characteristics were associated with an adverse prognosis during the first 3 months and 1 year after hospital discharge for hf when the characteristics of post - discharge decedents were examined , comparing survivors hospitalized in 1995 with those hospitalized in 2000 ( data not shown ) .\nsimilarly , when the characteristics of individuals hospitalized with acute hf who died during the first year after hospital discharge were compared with those who did not die over this period , post - discharge decedents were older , had a lower bmi , and were more likely to have had anemia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , or hf previously diagnosed ( table 2 ) .\npersons who died during the first year after hospital discharge had a different symptom profile at the time of hospital admission than persons who survived this period .\ndecedents in the first year after hospital discharge were also less likely than survivors to have been treated with effective cardiac therapies .\na relatively similar profile of demographic , clinical , and treatment characteristics was observed in 1-year post - discharge decedents as compared with post - discharge survivors during each of the 2 years under study ( data not shown ) .\na series of multivariable adjusted regression analyses were carried out for purposes of identifying factors independently associated with post - discharge death rates at 3 months and 1 year , overall and separately , in the two patient cohorts ( table 3 ) .\nadvanced age , a history of copd or stroke , generalized weakness at the time of hospital presentation , and lower egfr and systolic blood pressure findings were associated with an increased odds of dying during the first 3 months after hospital discharge for decompensated hf . on the other hand ,\na higher bmi and a history of hypertension were associated with a lower odds of dying within 3 months after hospital discharge .\nrelatively similar prognostic factors were associated with an adverse prognosis in each of the two study cohorts ( 1995 and 2000 ) , though their predictive importance varied slightly .\nsimilar factors to those identified as being of prognostic importance during the first 3 months after hospital discharge were associated with an increased risk for dying during the first year after hospital discharge ( table 3 ) .\nin addition , a history of previously diagnosed anemia , chronic kidney disease , and hf were associated with a greater likelihood of dying at 1 year ; the presence of orthopnea at the time of hospital admission was associated with a lower odds of dying at 1 year after hospital discharge for hf .\nrelatively similar factors were associated with an increased risk of dying during the first year after hospital discharge in patients hospitalized in 1995 and in those hospitalized during 2000 .\nafter an extensive review of hospital medical records and various disease diagnostic rubrics in which cases of possible hf might be found , a total of 1949 greater worcester residents were hospitalized for acute hf in the year 1995 and 2587 in the year 2000 ; of these , there were a total of 508 incident ( initial episode ) events of acute hf in 1995 and 645 cases of newly diagnosed acute hf in 2000 . in 1995 , 8.5% of all cases of acute hf died during their index hospitalization compared with 5.5% of all patients with acute hf in 2000 ; among incident cases of acute hf , 7.9% died in 1995 , whereas 5.7% died in 2000 . after excluding patients who died during their index hospitalization , in order to systematically characterize the post -

term prognosis may be due to the improved hospital treatment of acute hf , increased use and effectiveness of outpatient clinics for patients with hf , greater use of effective medical and nonpharmacologic regimens for hospital survivors of hf and greater adherence to these treatment modalities , and\/or increased provider attention to the use of guidelines for the more effective management of patients with hf .\nfew studies have described the long - term prognosis associated with acute hf from a more generalizable community - based perspective or determined whether or not the long - term prognosis of patients with hf has changed over time . in a large population - based study of olmsted county , minnesota , residents ,\nthe 5-year age - adjusted survival rates associated with hf improved significantly between 1991 and 1996.15 in an investigation of more than 1000 framingham heart study enrollees who had developed new - onset hf between 1950 and 1999 , improvements in survival after new - onset hf were estimated to be approximately 12% per decade for men and women enrolled in this seminal longitudinal study.16 improving trends in the 3-year survival rates after new - onset hf have also been demonstrated in a national study of older and younger patients from scotland with hf over the period 19861995.17 in a prior analysis of data collected in the worcester heart failure study , the authors of the present study described the long - term death rates associated with acute hf in residents of the worcester metropolitan area discharged after acute hf in 2000.8 the present study extends the findings of these community - based studies to a relatively contemporary and high - risk cohort of predominantly elderly patients hospitalized for acute hf .\nthe data suggest that hf remains a highly serious and lethal condition for most hospitalized patients but that patients long - term prognosis has been improving .\nthe authors hypothesize that increases in the percentage of patients receiving cardiac medications shown to be of benefit in improving the long - term prognosis of patients with hf over the years under study may have contributed to the improvements in long - term prognosis noted between 1995 and 2000 , though this hypothesis was unable to be directly tested due to the nonrandomized observational nature of the present investigation .\nto better understand the factors affecting prognosis after hf , particularly for patients encountered in the broader community setting , the independent prognostic significance of several demographic and clinical factors on long - term survival at different time points was evaluated . at 3 months after hospital discharge , older age ,\na lower blood pressure and bmi , and the presence of previously diagnosed copd , chronic kidney disease , stroke , and prior hf were associated with an increased risk of dying .\nsimilar prognostic variables have been identified in other studies evaluating short - term mortality among patients with hf.18,19 the association between copd and hf is well known , as between 10% and 50% of all hf patients also have coexisting copd.20 in a similar fashion to hf , copd is characterized by both recurrent acute exacerbations as well as by a general progression of disease over time.21 in addition , the stress on the cardiovascular system from complications of copd , including hypoxia , cor pulmonale , and polycythemia , could theoretically exacerbate hf over time , and the presence of copd may make it more difficult to diagnose hf.20 furthermore , beta blockers may not be tolerated by patients with both copd and hf , and beta agonist treatment of copd has been associated with increased mortality in these individuals.22 previous studies have found that approximately one - third of patients with hf will also have concomitant renal dysfunction,23 and as with copd , the relationship between chronic and acute renal disease and adverse prognosis has been well documented.24 renal dysfunction complicates acute and chronic treatment decisions in volume - overloaded patients , and renal function may be worsened by concomitant diuretic administration.25 the data of this present study suggest that early mortality after hospitalization for hf is strongly associated with advanced age , a previous history of hf , and the presence of other serious comorbid conditions , several of which appear to be secondary to chronic hf such as cardiorenal syndrome .\nrelatively similar factors were associated with an increased risk of dying during the first year after discharge .\nas has been noted in prior studies involving patients with acute hf , bmi was inversely related to mortality in the present study s hospitalized cohort.26,27 it has been hypothesized that cardiac cachexia may contribute to the  obesity paradox  in hf , although the causes of cachexia among patients with severe hf are complex and incompletely understood.28 it also remains unclear whether patients who are obese are more likely to develop or be diagnosed with acute hf earlier and the extent to which obesity affects prognosis once hf is manifest .\nfactors associated with a poor prognosis after hospital discharge for acute hf , including those associated with preserved versus systolic hf , merit further study , particularly with regards to better understanding the possible mechanisms involved so that appropriate advice and treatment regimens may be prescribed for patients with acute hf and its major subtypes .\nalthough considerable advances have been made and will continue to be made in the management of patients with acute hf , it is important that clinicians have a realistic understanding of the long - term prognosis associated with this clinical syndrome , including the extremely high death rates observed in the present study . clinicians also need to be aware of factors that adversely affect patients long - term survival , which may facilitate targeted treatment toward specific high - risk groups or help inform decisions about making realistic expectations about prognosis .\ndecisions about the use of more aggressive interventions for patients with hf must also take into account the presence and effect of various comorbidities on the patient s long - term survival outlook . in the present study ,\npost - discharge decedents were less likely to be discharged on effective cardiac medications , perhaps due to the fact that these patients were elderly , more likely to be hypotensive , and had worse renal function at the time of hospitalization compared with those who survived . in light of the fact that elderly patients tend to have more comorbid conditions ,\nmany of which also preclude the use of medications known to improve long - term survival , and since they may be less likely to be prescribed these medications due to their advanced age , it is not surprising that their prognosis is worse . a recent meta - analysis examining the efficacy of ace inhibitors in patients with chronic hf with preserved ejection fraction found that ace inhibitors reduced hf - related hospitalizations in elderly patients.29 another meta - analysis of more than 12,000 patients with systolic hf found that -blockers improved mortality in elderly patients , with a similar relative risk reduction in mortality between elderly and nonelderly patients.30 the aldosterone antagonists are another important class of medications shown to have benefit in patients with systolic hf.31 despite the known benefits associated with the use of these medications , they remain underprescribed in patients discharged from the hospital after decompensated hf , particularly in elderly patients.32 treating these high - risk patients with evidence - based therapies to optimize their long - term survival , while balancing risk , remains a clinical challenge and an area in need of further investigation .\nresidents of greater worcester with acute hf in 1995 and 2000 experienced high death rates after hospital discharge . indeed ,\nhospitalization for acute hf has been shown to be one of the strongest risk factors for dying in patients with a history of hf.14 on the other hand , the results of the present study showed encouraging improvements in the likelihood of surviving at both 3 months and 1 year in patients discharged from all metropolitan worcester hospitals after acute hf in 2000 as compared with 1995 . although the observational nature of the investigation does not allow for proof of causality , the observed improvements in long -

term prognosis after hf , and the rates of patient follow - up were excellent .\nthe limitations of the study include the inability to systematically examine the long - term prognosis of patients with acute hf according to type of left ventricular dysfunction ( systolic versus diastolic ) given the extent of missing data with regard to ejection fraction findings .\nin addition , it was not possible to assess the prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide and troponin laboratory values as these factors were not routinely measured at the greater worcester medical centers studied in 1995 and 2000 .\nthe results of the present study suggest that the long - term survival outlook for patients discharged from the hospital after acute hf remains poor but is improving .\na number of characteristics associated with a poor long - term prognosis were identified , several of which might be effectively intervened upon .\nthe present results provide further impetus for current efforts to improve the management of patients with acute hf and for the further development and increased use of long -

{"article":"human t - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( htlv-1 ) infection is of particular interest to the field of immunology as well as microbiology because htlv-1 is never eliminated from the host in spite of vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus but causes no disease in vast majority of infected subjects ( asymptomatic carriers : acs ) .\nalthough only approximately 2%-3% develop adult t cell leukemia ( atl ) [ 1 , 2 ] and another 0.25%3.8% develop chronic inflammatory diseases involving the central nervous system ( htlv-1-associated myelopathy \/ tropical spastic paraparesis : ham \/ tsp ) [ 3 , 4 ] , evaluation of the individual risk for developing diseases in each acs would certainly be of considerable importance especially in htlv-1 endemic area such as southern japan , the caribbean , central and south america , the middle east , melanesia , and equatorial regions of africa .\nfirst , how does htlv-1 persist in the individual host in spite of strong host immune response ?\nsecond , why do some htlv-1-infected people develop consequent diseases such as atl or ham \/ tsp , whereas the majority remains asymptomatic carriers of the virus ?  \nthird , how is the inflammatory lesion in ham \/ tsp initiated and maintained , and why is the inflammation specifically in thoracic spinal cord ?  \nthis review summarizes the past and recent works for ham \/ tsp attempting to resolve each of these questions .\nhtlv-1 is classified as a complex retrovirus in the genus deltaretrovirus of the subfamily orthoretrovirinae and infects 1020 million people worldwide [ 68 ] .\nhtlv-1 can be transmitted through sexual contact , injection drug use , and breastfeeding from mother to child [ 10 , 11 ] .\nalthough htlv-1 infection is associated with a range of nonmalignant chronic inflammatory diseases in the eyes , the lungs , or the skeletal muscles , ham \/ tsp is the bestrecognized with chronic progressive myelopathy characterized by spastic paraparesis , sphincter dysfunction , and mild sensory disturbance in the lower extremities . to date , more than 3,000 cases of ham \/ tsp patients have been reported in htlv-1 endemic areas .\nsporadic cases have also been described in nonendemic areas such as the united states and europe , mainly in immigrants from an htlv-1 endemic area . among acs ,\nthe lifetime risk of developing ham \/ tsp , which is different among different ethnic groups , ranges between 0.25% and 4% .\nit has been reported that the annual incidence of ham \/ tsp is higher among jamaican subjects than among japanese subjects ( 20 versus 3 cases\/100,000 population ) , with a two to three times higher risk for women in both populations [ 1316 ] .  \npathological analysis of ham \/ tsp autopsy materials indicates that the disease affects the spinal cord , predominantly at the thoracic level [ 1719 ] .\nloss of myelin and axons in the lateral , anterior , and posterior columns is associated with perivascular and parenchymal lymphocytic infiltration with the presence of foamy macrophages , proliferation of astrocytes , and fibrillary gliosis .\nthe presence of atypical lymphocytes ( so - called  flower cells  ) in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) , a moderate pleocytosis , and raised protein content in csf are typically found in ham \/ tsp patients .\noligoclonal bands , raised concentrations of inflammatory markers such as neopterin , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)- , interleukin ( il)-6 and interferon ( ifn)- , and an increased intrathecal antibody synthesis specific for htlv-1 antigens have also been described .\nclinical progression of ham \/ tsp is associated with increased proviral load in individual patients , and the ratio of proviral loads in csf cells \/ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) is significantly associated with clinically progressive disease . the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class i tetramer analysis of lymphocytes isolated from the csf of ham \/ tsp patients showed even higher frequencies of htlv-1 tax11 - 19-specific , hla - a*02-restricted cd8 lymphocytes compared to those of pbmcs .\ntherefore , an increased proliferation or migration of htlv-1-infected and\/or htlv-1-specific lymphocytes to the central nervous system ( cns ) might be closely associated with ham \/ tsp pathogenesis .\nprevious population association study of 202 cases of ham \/ tsp and 243 acs in kagoshima , htlv-1 endemic southern japan , revealed that one of the major risk factors is the htlv-1 proviral load .\nthe median proviral load was more than ten times higher in ham \/ tsp patients than in acs , and a high proviral load was also associated with an increased risk of progression to disease .\nhigher proviral load in ham \/ tsp patients than in acs was observed in other endemic area , such as the caribbean , south america , and the middle east .  \nit was suggested that genetic factors such as human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) are related to the high proviral load in ham \/ tsp patients and genetic relatives . in southern\njapan , possession of the hla - class i genes hla - a*02 and cw*08 was associated with a statistically significant reduction in both htlv-1 proviral load and the risk of ham \/ tsp , whereas possession of hla - class i hla - b*5401 and class ii hla - drb1 * 0101 predisposes to ham \/ tsp in the same population [ 28 , 29 ] . since the function of class i hla proteins is to present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) , these results imply that individuals with hla - a*02 or hla - cw*08 mount a particularly efficient ctl response against htlv-1 , which may be an important determinant of htlv-1 proviral load and the risk of ham \/ tsp . further analysis to look at nonhla host genetic factors revealed that nonhla gene polymorphism also affects the risk for developing ham \/ tsp .\nfor example , the tnf- promoter 863 a allele , and the longer ca repeat alleles of matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp)-9 promoter   predisposed to ham \/ tsp , whereas il-10 -592 a , stromal derived factor ( sdf)-1 + 801a   and il-15 + 191 c alleles   conferred protection against ham \/ tsp .\nthe polymorphisms of mmp-9 and il-10 promoter each linked to the htlv-1-encoded transactivator tax - mediated transcriptional activity of each gene [ 31 , 32 ] .\nalthough most studies of htlv-1 genotype have reported no association between variants of htlv-1 and the risk of ham \/ tsp , furukawa et al . reported the association between htlv-1 tax gene variation and the risk of ham \/ tsp .\nthe tax subgroup a that belongs to cosmopolitan subtype a was more frequently observed in ham \/ tsp patients and this effect was independent of protective allele hla - a*02 .\nhla - a*02 appeared to give protection against only one of the two prevalent sequence variants of htlv-1 , tax subgroup b that belongs to cosmopolitan subtype b but not against tax subgroup a in japanese population .\ninterestingly , hla - a*02 appears not to give protection against infection with cosmopolitan subtype a in a population in iran .\nthese findings suggest that both host genetic factors and htlv-1 subgroup play a part in determining the risk of ham \/ tsp .\nin htlv-1 infection , anti - htlv-1 antibody that often includes igm is detected in all infected individuals , either acs or patients with ham \/ tsp .\nit has been reported that ham \/ tsp patients generally had higher anti - htlv-1 antibody titer than acs with the similar htlv-1 proviral load [ 3436 ] .\nthese data suggest that there was persistent expression of htlv-1 proteins in vivo and the existence of an augmented humoral immune response to htlv-1 in ham \/ tsp patients .\ninterestingly , although antibody responses to the immunodominant epitopes of the htlv-1 envelope ( env ) proteins were similar in all of three clinical groups ( ham \/ tsp , atl , and acs ) , reactivity to four tax immunodominant epitopes was highest in ham \/ tsp ( 71%93% ) than atl patients ( 4%31% ) or acs ( 27%37% ) . in 2002 , levin et al . reported that antibodies that recognize htlv-1 tax protein can cross - react with a heterogenous nuclear riboprotein ( hnrnp)-a1 , suggesting intriguing evidence for antigen mimicry in htlv-1 infection .\nhowever , since the host protein hnrnp - a1 is not confined to the central nervous system but is widely expressed   and is not normally accessible to antibody attack , it is unlikely that anti - tax antibody explains the onset or initial tissue damage of ham \/ tsp .\nrather , anti - tax antibody might be associated with subsequent inflammation following initial tissue damage and disruption of blood brain barrier , which is probably caused by the antiviral immune responses to htlv-1 and induces the release of autoantigens .\nprevious reports indicated that patients with ham \/ tsp had both a lower frequency and a lower activity of nk cells ( especially the cd3cd16 subset ) than acs , although the results were not normalized with respect to the proviral load .\nsince an important mechanism of induction of nk cell - mediated killing is recognition by the nk cell of a complex of the nonpolymorphic mhc molecule hla - e bound to a peptide derived from the signal sequence of some other mhc class i molecules , the synthetic tetramers of hla - e with the hla - g signal sequence peptide were used to identify nk cells in ham \/ tsp patients .\nthe results clearly showed a lower frequency of hla - e tetramer - binding cells in ham \/ tsp patients than acs , and as in the earlier studies , this reduction in frequency was particularly notable in the cd3 cells whereas there was no significant difference in the frequency of hla - e tetramer - binding cd3 cells between patients with ham \/ tsp and acs .\nrecent data also suggest that the frequency of invariant nkt cells in the peripheral blood of ham \/ tsp patients is significantly decreased when compared with healthy subjects and\/or acs [ 42 , 43 ] .\nthese findings indicated that the activity of the nk or nkt cell response was associated with the presence or absence of ham \/ tsp .\ninterestingly , previous uncontrolled preliminary trial of viable lactobacillus casei strain shirota containing fermented milk for ham \/ tsp patients resulted in significant increase of nk cell activity with improvements in clinical symptoms .\nthus , circulating nk and nkt cells might also play an important role in the disease progression and the pathogenesis of ham \/ tsp .\nit has been reported that htlv-1 preferentially and persistently infects cd4cd25 lymphocytes in vivo , which contains the majority of the foxp3 tregs . in ham \/ tsp patients ,\nthe percentage of foxp3 tregs in cd4cd25 cells is lower than that in acs and uninfected healthy controls [ 45 , 47 ] whereas the percentage of foxp3 cells in the cd4 population tended to be higher in the ham \/ tsp patients than in the acs [ 4850 ] .\nas cd25 is induced by htlv-1 tax oncoprotein , it is most likely that the proportion of foxp3 cells falls in the cd4cd25 population , which contain both tregs and activated nontregs , in htlv-1-infected individuals especially ham \/ tsp patients .\ninterestingly , the frequency of htlv-1 negative foxp3cd4 cells positively correlated with the htlv-1 proviral load [ 23 , 49 ] and the ctl activity negatively correlated with the frequency of htlv-1 negative foxp3cd4 cells .\nthese data suggest that an increase in htlv-1 negative foxp3cd4 tregs is one of the chief determinants of the efficiency of t cell mediated immune control of htlv-1 .\nif such tregs reduce ctl activity , which in turn increases the htlv-1 proviral load , this activity increases the risk for developing ham \/ tsp . it is well known that antiviral cd4 t cell responses are of central importance in driving b - cell and cd8 t - cell responses in vivo .\nthe htlv-1 antigen most commonly recognized by cd4 t cells is the env protein [ 52 , 53 ] , in contrast with the immunodominance of tax in the cd8 t cell response [ 5456 ] . at a similar proviral load ,\npatients with ham \/ tsp had significantly increased frequency of virus - specific cd4 t - cells compared to that of acs [ 53 , 57 ] .\nthe antiviral t helper ( th)1 phenotype is also dominant among htlv-1-specific cd4 t cells in both acs and patients with ham \/ tsp , and there is a higher frequency of ifn- , tnf- , and il-2 production by cd4 t cells in patients with ham \/ tsp compared to acs of a similar proviral load [ 58 , 59 ] .\na role for cd4 + t cells in initiating and causing ham \/ tsp is also consistent with the immunogenetic observations that the possession of hla - drb1 * 0101 , which restricts immunodominant epitope of htlv-1 env gp21 , was associated with susceptibility to ham \/ tsp in independent htlv-1-infected populations in southern japan [ 28 , 29 ] and northeastern iran . accordingly , a synthetic tetramer of drb1 * 0101 and the immunodominant htlv-1 env380394 peptide was used to analyze env - specific cd4 t cells directly ex vivo .\nthe results showed that the frequency of tetramercd4 t cells was significantly higher in ham \/ tsp patients than in acs with similar proviral load .\nmoreover , direct ex vivo analysis of tetramercd4 t cells from two unrelated drb1 * 0101 positive ham \/ tsp patients indicated that certain t cell receptor ( tcr ) vs were utilized and antigen - specific amino acid motifs were identified in complementarity determining region ( cdr ) 3 from both patients .\nthese data suggest that the observed increase in virus - specific cd4 t cells in ham \/ tsp patients , which may contribute to cd4 t cell - mediated antiviral immune responses and to an increased risk of ham \/ tsp , was not simply due to the rapidly growing htlv-1-infected cd4 t cells but was the result of in vivo selection by specific mhc - peptide complexes , as observed in freshly isolated hla - a*0201\/tax11 - 19 tetramer cd8 t cells   and muscle infiltrating cells from ham \/ tsp patients and htlv-1-infected polymyositis patients .\nprevious reports indicated that the htlv-1-specific cd8 ctl is typically abundant , chronically activated , and mainly targeted to the viral transactivator protein tax .\nalso , as already mentioned , the median proviral load in pbmcs of ham \/ tsp patients was more than ten times higher than that in acs , and a high proviral load was also associated with an increased risk of progression to disease .\nfurthermore , hla - a*02 and hla - cw*08 genes were independently and significantly associated with a lower proviral load and a lower risk of ham \/ tsp [ 28 , 29 ] , and cd8 t cells efficiently kill autologous tax - expressing lymphocytes in fresh pbmcs in htlv-1-infected individuals .\nthese data have raised the hypothesis that the class i - restricted cd8 ctl response plays a critical part in limiting htlv-1 replication in vivo and that genetically determined differences in the efficiency of the ctl response to htlv-1 account for the risk for developing ham \/ tsp .\nhowever , since the frequency of htlv-1-specific cd8 t cells was significantly elevated in ham \/ tsp patients than in acs [ 64 , 65 ] and these cells have the potential to produce proinflammatory cytokines , there is a debate on the role of htlv-1-specific - cd8 t cells , that is , whether these cells contribute to the inflammatory and demyelinating processes of ham \/ tsp or whether the dominant effect of such cells in vivo is protective against disease , although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive .\nrecently , sabouri et al . reported that a frequency of cd8 t cells that were negative for costimulatory molecules such as cd27 , cd28 , cd80 , cd86 , and cd152 was significantly higher in patients with ham \/ tsp than in age - matched uninfected controls , but there was no such difference between acs and uninfected controls .\nthey also found a significantly lower frequency of perforin cells and granzyme b cells in the cd8 t cells in htlv-1-infected subjects than in uninfected controls , although there was no significant difference between patients with ham \/ tsp and acs .\nfurthermore , the lytic capacity of htlv-1-specific ctl between ham \/ tsp and acs estimated by cd107a mobilization assay showed the significantly lower cd107a staining in htlv-1-specific ctl in ham \/ tsp than acs .\nthese findings suggest that patients with ham \/ tsp have a high frequency of htlv-1-specific cd8 t cells with poor lytic capacity , whereas acs has a lower frequency of cells with high lytic capacity .\ndendritic cells are antigen - presenting cells which play a critical role in the regulation of the adaptive immune response . in htlv-1 infection\n, it has been shown that the dcs from ham \/ tsp patients were infected with htlv-1 , and the development of ham \/ tsp is associated with rapid maturation of dcs .\none of the hallmarks of htlv-1 infection is the in vitro proliferation of pbmcs when cultured in the absence of exogenous antigen or mitogen , referred to as spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation ( slp ) , and in ham \/ tsp patients , the levels of slp reflect the severity of the disease [ 70 , 71 ] .\ninterestingly , depletion of dcs from the ham \/ tsp patient 's pbmcs abolishes spl while supplementing dcs , but not b cells nor macrophages restore proliferation . dc dependent mechanism of slp was further supported by data showing that antibodies to mhc class ii , cd86 , and cd58 can block spl .\nrecently , jones et al . had demonstrated that human - derived both myeloid and plasmacytoid dcs are susceptible to infection with cell - free htlv-1 , and htlv-1-infected dcs can rapidly transfer virus to autologous primary cd4 t cells .\nfurthermore , in contrast to the previous report that cd4cd25 t cells are responsible for the stimulation of tax - specific cd8 t cells , it was recently demonstrated that , compared to the cd4cd25 t cells , the dcs are the major cell type responsible for the generation and maintenance of the tax - specific cd8 t cells both in vitro and in vivo .\nthese findings suggest that the interaction of dcs with htlv-1 is also crucial for the pathogenesis of ham \/ tsp .\nprevious studies have indicated that only a small proportion of the monocyte - macrophage lineage cells are infected with htlv-1 in peripheral blood   and that there has been no direct evidence indicating that htlv-1-infected cells of the monocyte - macrophage lineage cells are present in the cns .\nhowever , monocyte - macrophage lineage cells may also play important roles in the pathogenesis of ham \/ tsp , since it has been shown that the activation of macrophage and microglial cells within the cns closely correlated with the proviral load within the cns of ham \/ tsp patients .\nmeanwhile , it was also shown that a vast majority of bone marrow cells from ham \/ tsp patients are positive for htlv-1 proviral dna but negative for viral rna expression , whereas no htlv-1 proviral dna positive cd34 hematopoietic progenitor cells were detected in atl patients .\nthese results suggest that htlv-1-infected cells within the bone marrow may be a reservoir of htlv-1 in ham \/ tsp patients and play an important role in the etiology of neuroinflammation observed in ham \/ tsp .\nas shown in figure 1 , accumulating evidence suggests that the virus - host immunologic interactions play a pivotal role in ham \/ tsp pathogenesis .\ngenetically determined less efficient ctl response against htlv-1 may cause higher proviral load and antigen expression in infected individuals , which lead to activation and expansion of antigen - specific t cell responses , subsequent induction of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , and progression of ham \/ tsp development .","abstract":" human t - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( htlv-1 ) is a replication -

{"article":"the initial 8-component model of the csh approach was first introduced in 1987then termed  comprehensive school healthvia a special issue of the journal of school health.1 previously , school health was conceptualized as a  3-legged stool  comprised of health education , health services , and the healthy school environment.1 csh involved both implementation of programs and services within 8 high - quality components and systemic coordination in order to eliminate gaps and overlaps and best use available personnel , time and resources.1 the 8-components approach , and variants of it adopted by some states,2,3 is an innovation that has enjoyed an impressive dissemination and adoption curve.4 this likely was facilitated by the decision of cdc 's division of adolescent and school health to embrace the model.4 cdc , in collaboration with other organizations including the american school health association ( asha ) , implemented a number of actions in support of this new approach .\nfor example , cdc funded development of a book , health is academic : a guide to coordinated school health programs,5 that provided a broad delineation of csh and its components along with state and local dissemination strategies .\nin addition , cdc issued cooperative agreements to national organizations and state education agencies for the purpose of developing and disseminating policies and programs in support of csh.6,7 in 1992 , 5 state education agencies were initially selected to implement csh infrastructure such as funding and authorization , personnel and organizational placement , communication and linkages , and resources8 internally and with their sister state health agency over 5 years ; under this agreement , a csh coordinator position was funded in both the state - level education and health agencies and a health education specialist was funded in the education agency .\ntheir collective charge was to organize the analogous 8 csh components between their respective agencies and , then , to instigate csh adoption in local education agencies \/ school districts via technical assistance and training.8 in the late 1990s , cdc shifted the funding focus to encourage education agencies at both the state and local levels to achieve specific health - related outcomes such as increased physical activity , improved nutrition , prevention of tobacco use , and reduction in sexual risk behaviors through use of the csh approach . to date , cdc continues to support the tenets of csh , now incorporated into the wscc model , as a foundation for improving health outcomes of students in schools .\nalong with the publication of the book health is academic,5 documents from the american cancer society emerged to provide detailed guidance for implementing the essential structures of csh including employment of a health coordinator,9 and differentiation of a system - wide csh coordinating council10 from school building - level csh teams .\nthereafter , the american cancer society , with funding from cdc , conducted 2 sequential 18-month long school health coordinator leadership institutes designed to assist school districts ' adoption and implementation of csh.11 the initial institute was inaugurated in 1999 for 50 participants from across the united states ; these participants subsequently were expected to assume the role of csh coordinator in their respective school districts .\nthe second institute involved teams from 6 large urban school districts that enrolled hundreds of thousands of pre - k12 students .\nthereafter , the csh leadership institute model was replicated regionally by cdc - funded state education agencies , sometimes in collaboration with american cancer society affiliates , in the us northeast , mid - atlantic , midwest , and southwest regions plus california .\nthis strategy of supporting school district coordinators and teams to implement csh was shown to be effective.1216 in addition , the american cancer society has worked with cdc in more recent years to provide csh - related trainings to professionals teaching in higher education so that they can better prepare their students for teaching school health .\nascd 's initial foray into csh occurred in 2003 when the robert wood johnson foundation provided funding to develop a tool that educators could use to assess the status of csh in schools . following an extended development process that involved an expert panel review and conferences followed by field testing,15,16\nthe assessment tool was published as an ascd book entitled creating a healthy school using the healthy school report card.16 thereafter , the tool was used in several leadership institute replications,12,15,17 a canadian version was disseminated,18 and an extensive evaluation was conducted at 11 funded schools in both the united states and canada .\nthis evaluation , for the first time , documented the participation of the school principal as essential to successful csh implementation.19,20 these activities aligned and supported ascd 's subsequent development of a whole child approach launched in 2006 . in 2006 , ascd convened the commission on the whole child .\nthis commission was composed of leading thinkers , researchers , and practitioners all drawn from a wide variety of sectors and was charged with recasting the definition of a successful learner from one whose achievement is measured solely by academic tests , to one who is knowledgeable , emotionally and physically healthy , civically inspired , engaged in the arts , prepared for work and economic self - sufficiency , and ready for the world beyond formal schooling .\nthe commission was convened to start a dialogue to change what is meant by a successful school , a successful education , and ultimately a successful student .\nit was a discussion directly aimed at the current educational landscape of 2007dominated by the no child left behind act of 2001which was moving the nation toward an ever greater focus on an academics - above - all - else educational system .\nit asked how resources , both personnel and facilities , would be arranged if the child was key in the equation . in 2007 , dr gene r. carter , executive director of ascd , summed this up as follows :  if decisions about education policy and practice started by asking what works for the child , how would resources  time , space , and human  be arrayed to ensure each child 's success ?\nif the student were truly at the center of the system , what could we achieve?21 the whole child initiative was borne out of this discussion and this commission .\nit established 5 tenets which provide the framework for what a well - rounded , holistic , and effective education must focus upon , ensuring that each child , in each school , and in each community , is healthy , safe , engaged , supported , and challenged .\nthe tenets refer directly back to abraham maslow 's hierarchy of needs which was set out in the 1943 paper ,  a theory of human motivation.22 the original hierarchy established the foundational or base needs ( physiological ) at the bottom of the pyramid , followed subsequently by safety , love , and belongingness , esteem , and self - actualization .\nit established , via its pyramid structure , the understanding that achieving certain needs was possible only after others had been met .\nbased on this structure , the whole child tenets were arranged to demonstrate that health and then safety were fundamental in establishing environments in which students truly can be engaged , supported , and , ultimately , challenged . by focusing initial attention on  healthy ,  the whole child initiative actively promoted the role of school health services and health - promoting entities in the school and community .\nit shined a light on the imperative need for schools to consider not just the academic outcomes of the students but their health and well - being , as well , both as ways of improving educational outcomes and for fostering the holistic development of the individual child beyond the academic .\nit proposed that districts and schools place additional initial attention on the environment in which learning takes place before embarking directly upon that learning .\nagain , the whole child initiative was borne out of an understanding that students can not learn if they are not healthy and safe , and subsequently , will not learn if they are not engaged , supported , and challenged . in 2013 ,\nascd and cdc jointly convened a group of leaders in school health , education , and public health .\nstrengthen a unified and collaborative approach to learning and health23 building off the valuable tenets of both the whole child initiative , which was often viewed as primarily education - focused , and the csh approach , which was often viewed as primarily health - focused.23 the result was the whole school , whole community , whole child model  the next iteration in the evolution of these 2 conceptual approaches merged into 1 unified framework .\nthe use of csh and whole child approaches over time has provided many lessons learned .\ncsh , from its inception , has provided education and health professionals with a well - planned and easily understood framework for addressing the health - related aspects of the whole child . in the original model presented by allensworth and kolbe , 8 program components of csh stretched across a variety of student needs , and outcomes reflected in the model extended beyond health behaviors to include outcomes related to cognitive performance and educational achievement , both of which are linked to health.1 the innovation of the model was that it brought to the forefront the interplay between varied aspects of health and related school activities , and highlighted the interdependence of each component with the others .\nthe csh model provides a framework for conceptualizing interventions to address a wide spectrum of students ' needs that are often foundational for both students ' health and ability to learn in school .\ncsh is not simply a framework to inform and support implementation of health - related interventions ; research indicates that interventions conducted in the context csh can be successful . to date , most research has investigated either health education or health promotion interventions that focus on key topics within the csh model such as physical education or nutrition education2427 or use of csh processes and structures to bring about improvements in policies , programs , or partnerships.12,15,28,29 researchers have found evidence of effectiveness among several more narrowly focused programs implemented in the context of csh , including programs for physical activity,25 nutrition,26 and childhood obesity.24,27 the literature also contains several examples of csh approaches and related infrastructure facilitating success in the implementation of program activities.15,24,29 in addition , researchers have provided some support for an association between csh programs and outcomes related to academic achievement.30,31 one challenge for csh is that although csh provides a framework for addressing multiple aspects of children 's health , research , and evaluation activities that address student - level health and academic outcomes have rarely reflected the comprehensive nature of csh .\nthis may be part of the reason that , even as far back as 1998 , leaders in school health described csh as a program for which  the promise  thus far outshines its practice.5 much of the research on outcomes and effect of csh has been among the more narrowly defined programs situated within the context of csh , as described above .\nsimilarly , researchers have commented about the challenges of sustainability and resulting change from such narrowly focused and more programmatic - oriented approaches to csh.19 in a 2015 publication , valois et al discuss limitations of mere programmatic change and suggest that , instead , health and school improvement efforts can be enhanced and better sustained when they are founded on systemic changes within schools.20 likewise , cdc has recently explored csh through the perspective of a systemic framework in an attempt to better understand what makes the strongest programs successful.32 ultimately , schools are the domain of education and , as such , any initiative must have educational benefit to be successfully implemented and must be aligned to processes in the existing educational setting .\none challenge for csh has been that viewing it as a health initiative , focused on health for health 's sake only , has not required health and well - being to be conceptualized as a core component of an effective school and an effective educational system .\neach benefits from the other.33,34 it is why in 2002 the then director of cdc 's division of adolescent school health , lloyd kolbe wrote , in sum , if american schools do not coordinate and modernize their school health programs as a critical part of educational reform , our children will continue to benefit at the margins from a wide disarray of otherwise unrelated , if not underdeveloped , efforts to improve interdependent education , health , and social outcomes .\nand , we will forfeit one of the most appropriate and powerful means available to improve student performance.35 fortunately , several key lessons from csh suggest ways in which csh and related whole child approaches can be positioned in school settings . across the literature on csh , one of the key lessons to emerge is the critical nature of infrastructure within the school and district to support health - related activities . although infrastructure may vary from school to school and district to district\n, a few standard infrastructure recommendations for supporting csh implementation have included the presence of a school health coordinator , a district - level school health advisory or coordinating council , and school - level health teams or committees.3641 district - level and school - level councils \/ teams typically include school or district representatives from all 8 components of csh as well as community members , parents , and students .\nthese teams , with leadership and guidance from a school health coordinator , are typically responsible for coordination between the 8 csh components and implementing activities to improve health within schools.38 once this infrastructure is in place , the use of a systematic assessment and planning process can help coordinators and councils \/ teams identify their school or district 's specific health - related needs , prioritize those needs , and develop plans to effectively address them .\nthis assessment and planning process can take several different forms : some councils \/ teams structure this around use of the school health index42 or the healthy school report card.16,18 regardless of the tool or format used , this process can be most effective when it is data - driven and includes defining priorities , assessing existing and available resources , developing clear and measurable goals and objectives , and developing an action plan with a timeline for reaching those goals and objectives.38,39 in addition to having key infrastructure in place , the importance of having strong leaders \/ champions40,43 and administrative support and buy - in38 is well supported by the literature about csh.4,37,43 leaders and champions , from both within and outside of schools , can build support for csh in ways that allow its proponents to overcome challenges and barriers that might otherwise impede progress.40 in particular , one recent study conducted for and released by ascd found that leadership from school principals was critical for bringing about meaningful change in schools.19,20 administrative support and buy - in are critical for ensuring sustained commitment to csh and health - related goals .\nthis support may be evidenced by incorporation of health - related goals into vision and mission statements and\/or school improvement plans , assignment of staff to oversee school health , and allocation of resources to address health - related needs .\nthe role of leadership and integration into school improvement plans is further articulated in a 2011 report from ascd that described findings from its work in integrating a whole child approach with a focus on health and well - being into the systems and functions of the school.19 the report summarized key actions schools had undertaken to ensure integration and sustainability , and as a result , identified  9 levers  that mobilized change in school communities : ( 1 ) the principal as leader ; ( 2 ) active and engaged leadership ; ( 3 ) distributive leadership ; ( 4 ) integration with the school improvement plan ; ( 5 ) effective use of data for continuous school improvement ; ( 6 ) ongoing and embedded professional development ; ( 7 ) authentic and mutually beneficial community collaborations ; ( 8) stakeholder support of the local efforts ; ( 9 ) the creation or modification of school policy related to the process.19,20 of these 9 levers , 2 appeared particularly influential  the principal as leader and integration with the school improvement plan .\nthese were particularly important for initiatives , especially ones that may at first glance be viewed as superfluous to the school 's primary mission , to be successfully implemented and sustained .\nthe commonality across these 2 levers is that they establish an educational rationale to the process and the initiative .\nhaving tangible acceptance , commitment , and active engagement of the principal as seminal to any health - related improvement initiative allows the school , staff , students , and families to view that initiative as educationally beneficial .\nsubsequently they are more accepting and open to seeing the connections between health , well - being , safety , connectedness , and pedagogy ; and any changes or adaptations related to the initiative are more likely to be integrated into the broader policies affecting the school . by integrating the initiative or\nfocus with the school improvement plan , one additionally aligns it to effective education and pedagogy , thereby allowing the initiative to become a key part of what the administration and its teachers discuss and target annually , and the initiative becomes further integrated into adjunct policies .\nthe school improvement plan provides the direction for and purpose of the school , as well as the implementation pathway.19,20 a whole child approach to education  one which seeks to ensure that each child is healthy , safe , engaged , supported , and challenged  appreciates that , \nchildren do not develop and learn in isolation , but rather grow physically , socially , emotionally , ethically , expressively , and intellectually within networks of families , schools , neighborhoods , communities , and our larger society.21 initiatives to help address these aspects of growth , whether framed as whole child or csh initiatives , can best gain footing when those initiatives are aligned with the purpose of the school  its mission , policies , and pedagogy .\nfinally , from years of research and practice in csh and a whole child approach , the vital role of the community has emerged . in a whole child approach , \nauthentic and mutually beneficial community collaborations  have been identified as a key lever of shifting a school 's culture,19 and in csh , it has become clear that community assets can be a lifeline for csh activities . furthermore , csh offers a framework by which a school or district can harness community assets .\nas other researchers have previously suggested , the csh approach may be best explained and understood in the context of an ecological framework,4,40 which can help account for the context and influence of community on health . with the integration of community members as stakeholders and participants in district - level councils and school - level teams , csh structures and processes\noffer a natural opportunity for community organization and community building that can help make key community resources available to students and staff and can strengthen the overall community at the same time .\nalthough the appreciation of what constitutes an effective education is changing and has changed since both the introduction of no child left behind44 and , somewhat coincidentally with the introduction of the whole child initiative , there is still and likely always will be a necessity to link any new initiative back to the processes and functions of the school and its educational outcomes whether these be academic , cognitive , or developmental . as other researchers have suggested , shifting the language and framing of csh and a whole child approach to reflect more of a general school - improvement focus , one that can meet the needs of the whole child and resonate with both educators and community members outside of the health profession , may enable health professionals to better achieve the goal of healthy students.19,45 in a 2010 article , hoyle et al went so far as to say  insistence on alignment of programs under the \nhealth banner is detrimental to the purpose and mission of both school health and school improvement.45 instead , they suggested that school health professionals could offer knowledge and skills in the processes of developing , implementing , and evaluating health - related interventions.45 these processes , implemented through the foundational infrastructure components used to support csh and seen in the 9 levers explored through the whole child approach , can facilitate improvement in a variety of student outcomes , including those related to health .\nthe initial 8-component model of the csh approach was first introduced in 1987then termed  comprehensive school healthvia a special issue of the journal of school health.1 previously , school health was conceptualized as a  3-legged stool  comprised of health education , health services , and the healthy school environment.1 csh involved both implementation of programs and services within 8 high -

level school health advisory or coordinating council , and school - level health teams or committees.3641 district - level and school - level councils \/ teams typically include school or district representatives from all 8 components of csh as well as community members , parents , and students .\nthese teams , with leadership and guidance from a school health coordinator , are typically responsible for coordination between the 8 csh components and implementing activities to improve health within schools.38 once this infrastructure is in place , the use of a systematic assessment and planning process can help coordinators and councils \/ teams identify their school or district 's specific health - related needs , prioritize those needs , and develop plans to effectively address them .\nthis assessment and planning process can take several different forms : some councils \/ teams structure this around use of the school health index42 or the healthy school report card.16,18 regardless of the tool or format used , this process can be most effective when it is data - driven and includes defining priorities , assessing existing and available resources , developing clear and measurable goals and objectives , and developing an action plan with a timeline for reaching those goals and objectives.38,39 in addition to having key infrastructure in place , the importance of having strong leaders \/ champions40,43 and administrative support and buy - in38 is well supported by the literature about csh.4,37,43 leaders and champions , from both within and outside of schools , can build support for csh in ways that allow its proponents to overcome challenges and barriers that might otherwise impede progress.40 in particular , one recent study conducted for and released by ascd found that leadership from school principals was critical for bringing about meaningful change in schools.19,20 administrative support and buy - in are critical for ensuring sustained commitment to csh and health - related goals .\nthis support may be evidenced by incorporation of health - related goals into vision and mission statements and\/or school improvement plans , assignment of staff to oversee school health , and allocation of resources to address health - related needs .\nthe role of leadership and integration into school improvement plans is further articulated in a 2011 report from ascd that described findings from its work in integrating a whole child approach with a focus on health and well - being into the systems and functions of the school.19 the report summarized key actions schools had undertaken to ensure integration and sustainability , and as a result , identified  9 levers  that mobilized change in school communities : ( 1 ) the principal as leader ; ( 2 ) active and engaged leadership ; ( 3 ) distributive leadership ; ( 4 ) integration with the school improvement plan ; ( 5 ) effective use of data for continuous school improvement ; ( 6 ) ongoing and embedded professional development ; ( 7 ) authentic and mutually beneficial community collaborations ; ( 8) stakeholder support of the local efforts ; ( 9 ) the creation or modification of school policy related to the process.19,20 of these 9 levers , 2 appeared particularly influential  the principal as leader and integration with the school improvement plan .\nthese were particularly important for initiatives , especially ones that may at first glance be viewed as superfluous to the school 's primary mission , to be successfully implemented and sustained .\nthe commonality across these 2 levers is that they establish an educational rationale to the process and the initiative .\nhaving tangible acceptance , commitment , and active engagement of the principal as seminal to any health - related improvement initiative allows the school , staff , students , and families to view that initiative as educationally beneficial .\nsubsequently they are more accepting and open to seeing the connections between health , well - being , safety , connectedness , and pedagogy ; and any changes or adaptations related to the initiative are more likely to be integrated into the broader policies affecting the school . by integrating the initiative or\nfocus with the school improvement plan , one additionally aligns it to effective education and pedagogy , thereby allowing the initiative to become a key part of what the administration and its teachers discuss and target annually , and the initiative becomes further integrated into adjunct policies .\nthe school improvement plan provides the direction for and purpose of the school , as well as the implementation pathway.19,20 a whole child approach to education  one which seeks to ensure that each child is healthy , safe , engaged , supported , and challenged  appreciates that ,\n children do not develop and learn in isolation , but rather grow physically , socially , emotionally , ethically , expressively , and intellectually within networks of families , schools , neighborhoods , communities , and our larger society.21 initiatives to help address these aspects of growth , whether framed as whole child or csh initiatives , can best gain footing when those initiatives are aligned with the purpose of the school  its mission , policies , and pedagogy .\nfinally , from years of research and practice in csh and a whole child approach , the vital role of the community has emerged . in a whole child approach , \nauthentic and mutually beneficial community collaborations  have been identified as a key lever of shifting a school 's culture,19 and in csh , it has become clear that community assets can be a lifeline for csh activities . furthermore , csh offers a framework by which a school or district can harness community assets .\nas other researchers have previously suggested , the csh approach may be best explained and understood in the context of an ecological framework,4,40 which can help account for the context and influence of community on health . with the integration of community members as stakeholders and participants in district - level councils and school - level teams , csh structures and processes\noffer a natural opportunity for community organization and community building that can help make key community resources available to students and staff and can strengthen the overall community at the same time .\nalthough the appreciation of what constitutes an effective education is changing and has changed since both the introduction of no child left behind44 and , somewhat coincidentally with the introduction of the whole child initiative , there is still and likely always will be a necessity to link any new initiative back to the processes and functions of the school and its educational outcomes whether these be academic , cognitive , or developmental . as other researchers have suggested , shifting the language and framing of csh and a whole child approach to reflect more of a general school - improvement focus , one that can meet the needs of the whole child and resonate with both educators and community members outside of the health profession , may enable health professionals to better achieve the goal of healthy students.19,45 in a 2010 article , hoyle et al went so far as to say  insistence on alignment of programs under the \nhealth banner is detrimental to the purpose and mission of both school health and school improvement.45 instead , they suggested that school health professionals could offer knowledge and skills in the processes of developing , implementing , and evaluating health - related interventions.45 these processes , implemented through the foundational infrastructure components used to support csh and seen in the 9 levers explored through the whole child approach , can facilitate improvement in a variety of student outcomes , including those related to health .\nfor school and education agency staff to be motivated and able to successfully implement the csh and whole child tenants reflected in the wscc model , staff members likely need evidence - based suggestions for the implementation process and articulation of outcomes that can be reasonably expected . to provide this information ,\nfirst , we recommend that researchers investigating csh and the whole child approach , as now reflected in the wscc model , continue to focus on the ecological aspects of the model , particularly the role of community .\nschool staff involved in csh programs have reported that the csh approach has helped their schools develop new partnerships within their communities,12,46 and these partnerships can be critical for meeting students ' needs .\nthis vital role of community is reflected in the new wscc model in both the community involvement component as well as the positioning of all of the other csh - based components within the context of community.23 to support school and district staff , we recommend school health experts consider developing tools and recommendations for how the wscc model can best be used to assess and harness community assets to enable schools to meet the needs of the whole child . such tools and recommendations  developed using language that can resonate with a broad range of stakeholders including not only health professionals but also educators and community members as well  could serve as valuable resources to school and district staff , particularly in an environment filled with more and more demands on fewer and fewer resources .\nsecond , we recommend that researchers exploring the wscc model seek to provide additional insight into the  how  and not just the  what  of the model .\nspecifically , the traditional 8-component csh model and now the wscc model both provide a pragmatic visual representation of the different aspects of health that can be addressed through comprehensive approaches .\nthe wscc model takes this a step farther by presenting the role of  coordinating policy , process , and practice  visually within the model .\nhowever , neither model is designed to provide school and health professionals with explanations of how to do that coordination .\nalthough many professionals have sought to add to the  how  descriptions by delineating key infrastructure and processes used in csh,3641,47 future researchers and practitioners in school health can seek to provide additional information and tools to help articulate how such infrastructure pieces and key processes can be coordinated and implemented effectively . to the extent that the wscc model functions as a system connecting students , families , schools , and communities , the literature on systems change may offer insight into ways school health professionals can better articulate how the  coordinated  aspect of the model can be accomplished and strengthened .\nfinally , we recommend research be conducted about the wscc model as a whole , not simply individual components within the model , in order to assess the cumulative effect that can result from a comprehensive approach to addressing health and the whole child . in the last several decades\n, researchers have gathered additional evidence to support the use of csh , and importantly , to begin to understand the structures and processes necessary to use csh effectively . what continues to remain largely missing from the scientific literature is a holistic examination of the full csh model that assesses a broad range of outcomes in 1 comprehensive evaluation .\nin theory , the value of the csh model comes from the synergistic effect gained from coordinated interventions to address multiple aspects of co - occurring needs .\nexamining the new wscc model , inclusive of foundational csh concepts , through research that is longitudinal in nature and , ideally , designed to represent schools and communities of various sizes48 may provide researchers with the best opportunity to capture the full impact of the model 's value for improving the health and well - being of youth .\npreparation of this paper did not include performing original research requiring inclusion of human subjects .\npreparation of this paper did not include performing original research requiring inclusion of human subjects .","abstract":" backgroundthe new whole school , whole community , whole child ( wscc ) model , designed to depict links between health and learning , is founded on concepts of coordinated school health ( csh ) and a whole child approach to education.methodsthe existing literature , including scientific articles and key publications from national agencies and organizations , was reviewed and synthesized to describe ( 1 ) the historical context for csh and a whole child approach , and ( 2 ) lessons learned from the implementation and evaluation of these approaches.resultsthe literature revealed that interventions conducted in the context of csh can improve health -

{"article":"total swine numbers in 2011 reached 39.3 million units in brazil , up 0.9% from 2010 according to the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ( ibge ) .\nthe intensification of feedlot swine production is responsible for producing large amounts of liquid waste , which once released without treatment into nature can pollute water springs , affect air quality from gas emissions , and cause insect proliferation .\nfeedlot conditions result in high prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms on floor surfaces , as the digestive and urinary systems of pigs are their main routes of waste disposal .\nit is important to take into account that waste allows pathogen survival and dissemination for days to months .\nthe public health aspect , as one of the most relevant aspects of using effluents for productive purposes , is still object of controversy in the international technical - scientific community .\nthere are still controversies with regard to admissible risks , and by extension , the necessary and sufficient quality of effluents in order to guarantee health protection .\nthe consensus extends only to the acknowledgment that irrigation using untreated wastewater offers real risks of transmitting diseases , and that any irrigation practice using sewage involves public health risks .\nnevertheless , there are still controversies with regard to admissible risk levels , and by extension , the level of treatment and the necessary and sufficient quality of effluents in order to guarantee health safety [ 46 ] . in brazil , there are no specific rules establishing parasitological parameters for the reuse of low - quality water . therefore , the guidelines set by the world health organization are followed [ 7 , 8 ] . for microbiological parameters , resolutions 357\/2005 and 375\/2006 by brazil 's national environmental council ( conama )\nconama resolution 357\/2005 establishes standards for water quality and uses and consequently for effluent release in water bodies . and conama resolution 375\/2006 deals specifically with sewage sludge .\nthere is no specific legislation for farming waste or similar [ 9 , 10 ] .\nconama resolution 375 from 2006 uses microbiological and parasitological parameters to classify sludge for use as fertilizer in agriculture , into type a ( or derived product ) or type b. sludge is classified as type a when the concentration of thermotolerant coliforms is below 10  mpn  g  ts , and viable helminth eggs are below 0.25 egg  g  ts . for sludge\nto be classified as type b , the concentration of thermotolerant coliforms must be over 10 and below 10  mpn  g  ts , and helminth eggs should be over 0.25  g  ts and below 10 eggs  g  ts . according to van haandel and marais ,\nthe guidelines recommended by the world health organization are based on theoretical models , epidemiological evidence , and information available on the efficiency of pathogen removal , particularly through the use of stabilization ponds .\nthe bacteriological and parasitological standards recommended by the who forum restricted irrigation are 10 mpn ( 100  ml ) and 1 helminth egg  l , respectively .\namerican standards require the absence of pathogenic indicators ( including viruses and protozoa ) for unrestricted irrigation [ 5 , 12 ] .\ntherefore , to use the treated effluent for irrigation and\/or fertilization and reactor sludge fed with wastewater , it is essential to know its physical - chemical characteristics and microbiological contamination indicators , in order to establish adequate environmental protection measures and the appropriate choice of technologies for treatment and final disposal .\nmoreover , according to chernicharo , some of the advantages of anaerobic treatment are low energy consumption , very low operational costs , small space requirements , methane production , and tolerance against high organic loads . among anaerobic treatment systems , the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket ( uasb ) reactor stands out .\nin the uasb reactor , a significant portion of suspended solids present in raw sewage ( including helminth eggs ) are retained , which are retained in the bed of thick biological sludge given their density and due to hydraulic upflow .\nin addition to this retention of solids in the bottom of the reactor , there is also sedimentation of biological sludge that eventually seeps out from the sludge digestion compartment , but this requires installation of a solids separator in the upper part of the tank . despite the advantages attributed to anaerobic reactors , the effluent produced usually does not meet quality standards set by environmental legislation , with regard to the number of helminth eggs , total , and thermotolerant coliforms , thus requiring the addition of a posttreatment system .\none alternative for posttreatment is the trickling filter ( tf ) , which works with continuous feeding and without unit flooding .\nit is an aerobic reactor , permanently subject to air replacement , which naturally circulates in the empty spaces of the support medium , providing the necessary oxygen for microorganism respiration . according to van haandel and marais , the combined anaerobic \/ aerobic system has great potential in reducing construction and operational costs .\nseveral works have been carried out using this combination to treat swine production wastewater , aiming to remove coliforms , among others .\nduda and oliveira   used a system consisting of anaerobic reactors ( uasb and anaerobic filter ) and aerobic reactors ( trickling filter ) . oliveira and\nsantana   used two uasb reactors followed by an aerobic sequencing batch reactor ( sbr ) , and santos , who also worked with an anaerobic \/ aerobic \/ anoxic treatment system , obtained significant coliform removal efficiency .\nthis work evaluated two treatment systems : one with two uasb reactors in series and another consisting of uasb reactors , anaerobic filter , trickling filter , and decanter , placed in series , in the removal of coliforms and helminth eggs from swine production wastewater .\nthe experimental facilities consisted of two treatment systems . system i consisted of two uasb reactors , with volumes of 510 and 209  l , placed in series ( figure 1 ) , as described by oliveira and santana .\nsystem ii consisted of a uasb reactor , anaerobic filter , trickling filter , and decanter , placed in series , with volumes of 300 , 190 , 250 , 150  l , respectively ( figure 2 ) , as described by duda and oliveira . in the anaerobic and aerobic biological filters ,\npolypropylene rings were used as support medium , with specific surface area of 101  m \/ m .\nthe swine production wastewaters utilized to feed the treatment systems were collected daily in a feedlot for growing and finishing swine , at a commercial property located in the city of jaboticabal , sp , which uses shallow water channels to transport the waste .\nthe collected wastewater was first sieved ( 3  mm mesh ) to separate rough solids ; next , the water was stored in boxes and pumped to the first - stage reactors .\nthe other reactors were gravity fed . the operating conditions applied on the systems are described in table 1 .\nthe anaerobic reactors were regarded as stable when the coefficient of variation ( cv ) values of the removal efficiencies of total cod and volatile suspended solids ( vss ) , concentration of volatile acids ( tva ) , and methane production ( ch4 ) were lower than 20% ; in the trickling filter , whenever average cod and vss values in the effluent and their efficiencies had cv below 20% . inflow and\noutflow samplings were carried out at the end of the assays , after 60 days of operation in assay 1 , 30 days in assay 2 , 60 days in assay 3 , and 75 days in assay 4 .\nthe laboratory exams performed were total and thermotolerant coliform counts and number of helminth egg in inflows , effluents , and reactor sludge and decanter . to determine coliforms , the multiple - tube technique was used in accordance with cetesb norm l.5 202   and in conformity with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater .\nthe results were expressed in mpn ( most probable number ) per 100  ml of sample .\nsamples of the inflows were collected in the incoming pipes of the anaerobic reactors and from outflows in the outgoing pipes of the anaerobic reactors , trickling filter , and decanter .\nthe collections were performed at the end of each assay , with two replications per assay .\nsludge samples were collected at all sampling points . for processing , sample preparation , and counting of helminth eggs ,\nthe study used the sedimentation method developed by bailenger   and modified by ayres and mara .\nthis method was chosen due to its simplicity and the low cost of the reagents used , in addition to the fact that it allows recovery of a wide range of helminths usually found in wastewaters , particularly nematode eggs ( ascaris sp .\n, trichuris sp . , and hookworms ) which are the specific parasitological indicators found in the world health organization guide for reuse in agriculture .\nthe samples from inflows and outflows ( 10  l of each ) were collected and placed in 15  l polyethylene drums and processed after two hours of sedimentation .\nthe sampling site for the inflows was in the incoming piping of the anaerobic reactors .\noutflows were sampled in the outgoing pipes of the anaerobic reactors , trickling filter , and decanter .\nthe sludge samples were collected at two collection points along the reaction chamber of the reactors : ( 1 ) uasb reactors in system i , sludge bed and blanket , at points 400 and 1200  mm from the inflow entrance ( figure 1 ) ; ( 2 ) uasb reactor in system ii , sludge bed and blanket , at points 400 and 1180  mm from the inflow entrance ; ( 3 ) anaerobic filter in system ii , at points 380 and 940  mm from the inflow entrance ; ( 4 ) decanter in system ii , 1100  mm from the inflow entrance ( figure 2 ) .\nat each point , a 1-l sample of sludge was collected and placed in polyethylene bottles .\nthe mean values of the numbers of total and thermotolerant coliforms in the inflows of systems i and ii ranged between 1.40e + 07 and 2.40e + 08 mpn ( 100  ml ) in assays 1 to 4 . in the effluents of uasb reactors ( r1 ) , they decreased to mean values of 1.50e + 06 to 4.40e + 07 mpn ( 100  ml ) as shown in tables 2 and 3 . in the effluent of the uasb reactor ( r2 ) of treatment system i ,\nthe reduction was maintained to mean values of total and thermotolerant coliforms of 1.90e + 05 to 1.70e +  07  mpn ( 100  ml ) in assays 1 to 4 ( table 2 ) . in the anaerobic filter of treatment system\nii there were decreases as well , down to mean values of 4.30e + 05 to 2.00e + 07 mpn ( 100  ml ) of total and thermotolerant coliforms , in assays 1 to 4 ( table 3 ) . with the addition of tf , a decrease was obtained to values of 2.00e + 04 to 2.20e + 06 for assays 1 to 4 . in the decanter ,\nthe reduction was maintained to mean values of total and thermotolerant coliforms of 2.40e + 04 to 1.20e + 06 in assays 1 to 4 . in treatment system\ni , with two uasb reactors in series , an effluent with superior microbiological quality for the evaluated coliform indicators , except in assay 4 , when the values were identical for total coliforms . in both treatment systems , in the anaerobic reactors , the effect of hrt reduction became evident , especially in assay 4 , hindering the microbiological quality of the effluent by raising the count of total and thermotolerant coliforms .\nneto   obtained higher values of total thermotolerant coliforms in swine production wastewater of 1.00e + 07  mpn ( 100  ml ) similar values as those found in the present work .\nsantos et al .   obtained higher values of total coliforms , totaling 1,00e + 08 to 1,00e + 10 mpn ( 100  ml ) and thermotolerant coliforms values of 1,00e + 08 to 1,00e + 09  mpn ( 100  ml ) . oliveira and\nsantana   obtained similar or slightly higher results when evaluating coliform concentrations in swine production wastewater .\nafter treatment in both uasb reactors of system i , the authors also obtained a marked reduction in the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms in the effluent of r1 to average values of 4.30e + 06 to 4.30e + 07  mpn ( 100  ml ) and of r2 , which decreased to average values of 2.40e + 06 to 4.30e + 07  mpn ( 100  ml ) .\ntherefore , the evaluated anaerobic treatment systems revealed a reduction potential of two logarithmic units for the removal of total and thermotolerant coliforms , with relatively small variations among assays 1 to 3 , in which the hrt was 59 to 28  h. with the decrease of hrt to the range of 15 to 16  h in assay 4 , the removals were in the order of one logarithm .\nthe average removal efficiencies of total and thermotolerant coliforms were 92.92% to 99.93% in the anaerobic reactors of treatment systems i and ii in assays 1 to 4 ( figures 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .\nthe highest efficiencies for removal of coliforms occurred in assays 1 , 2 , and 3 .\nthe lower hrt and temperature in assay 4 resulted in lower coliform removal and were caused principally by the reduced efficiency in the uasb reactor ( r2 ) and anaerobic filter of treatment systems i and ii , in which the hrts were 4.5 and 5.2  h , respectively . even while achieving 99.93% removal efficiency of thermotolerant coliforms in the effluents of anaerobic reactors of treatment systems i and ii\n, the coliform concentrations still exceeded standards established for use in plant irrigation according to brazilian legislation conama 357\/2005 and for treated outflows according to the guidelines set by the world health organization [ 7 , 8 ] . analyzing swine production wastewater from uasb reactor and anaerobic filter with hrt 12.0 and of 8.5  h , respectively , pereira - ramirez et al .  \nobtained concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms in the final effluent of 2.51e + 07  mpn ( 100  ml ) .\nthe anaerobic filter ( af ) is removed between 80 and 96% of thermotolerant coliforms , similar and higher values than those obtained in this work .\nbuzato , assessing the performance of an upflow anaerobic filter in the treatment of domestic sewage using a uasb reactor , obtained an average removal efficiency of total and thermotolerant coliforms of 81 and 78% , respectively .\naverage removal efficiency in the uasb reactor was 71% for total coliforms and 69% for thermotolerant coliforms .\nthe anaerobic filter showed average removal efficiencies of total and thermotolerant coliforms of 41% and 33% , respectively , lower values than that found in this work .\nduda   worked with system ii in the treatment of swine production wastewater ; the highest efficiencies obtained in the removal of thermotolerant coliforms were 99.86% in the uasb reactor and anaerobic filter by themselves . after adding the trickling filter ( tf ) as posttreatment ,\nthe efficiencies were 99.94 and 99.99% in the assays with hrt of 44.7 and 66.6  h for the system of anaerobic treatment and posttreatment higher values than that obtained in this work , which demonstrates that greater hrt results in more significant removal efficiency .\nsystem ii resulted in higher removal efficiency values than system i , consisting only of the uasb anaerobic reactors in series , confirming the importance of posttreatment , as shown in figures 5 and 6 .\nthe adequacy of bacteriological quality in the final effluent , in order to meet the standards of environmental legislation , will depend essentially on the characteristics of the receiving water body . in that sense , in order to meet quality standards of a class 2 river at most 1.00e + 03 mpn ( 100  ml ) , the dilution and concentration of coliforms upstream from the discharge points will be preponderant factors in the analysis [ 9 , 15 , 16 , 28 ] .\nin uasb ( r1 ) and uasb ( r2 ) reactors of system i , a higher concentration of coliforms was observed in the bed of biological sludge , point 1 , which is located at the bottom of the reactor .\nthe average concentrations of total coliforms at point 2 were 1.50e + 08 to 9.10e + 08 mpn\n( 100  ml ) and thermotolerant coliforms concentrations ranged between 1.10e + 08 and 6.50e + 08 mpn ( 100  ml ) in all assays . at the points 4 and 5 ( figure 1 ) , in the biological sludge blanket , which is located at the top of the reaction chamber from the uasb reactor ( r1 ) , the concentrations of coliforms decreased one or two logarithmic units , as shown in table 4 .\nthese numbers of coliforms remained in the bed of biological sludge from the second uasb reactor ( r2 ) , in which it also there was reduction of one more logarithmic unit in the sludge blanket . with regard to the sludge in system\nii , at point 1 of the uasb reactor and af , the concentration of coliforms was also higher compared to the other points in all assays and decreased as the distance from the reactor bed increased , as shown in table 5 . in the treatment of domestic sewage using uasb reactors , backes   evaluated sludge and obtained thermotolerant coliform values of 2.10e + 03 mpn g  ts , classifying it as type - b sludge , giving the possibility of reuse , similar to the values found in this work .\nsantos et al . , working at the sewage treatment plant of rios das antas , using uasb reactors , operated by the paran state sanitation utility , found concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms below 10 mpn  gts ; as such , that residue could be used as fertilizer in crop soils .\nit is worth reminding that there is no specific legislation for sludge from the swine treatment wastewaters .\nconama resolution 375   defines criteria and procedures for the agricultural use of sewage sludge created in sewage treatment plants and their byproducts . to reuse sludge in agriculture\n( type a ) , the concentrations of total and thermotolerant coliforms must stay below 1.00e + 03  mpn g  ts and below 1.00e + 06 mpn  g  ts for type b. only sludge produced in the uasb reactor ( r2 ) of system i ( assays 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) showed values that are in accordance with the standards set by conama resolution 375   for reuse in agriculture as type - b sludge . \n\nparasitological analysis \n \n table 6 shows the results of the identification and count of the average number of helminth eggs obtained in the samples of inflow and outflow of uasb reactors ( r1 and r2 ) placed in series , at pilot scale , of treatment system i , in assays 1 , 2 , 3 and 4\n, while comparing swine farms in slotted or cement floors , described greater occurrence of ascaris suum on cement .\nfacilities with shallow pools are conducive to the dissemination of parasite agents when inadequately used , which explains the presence of ascaris suum eggs in the inflow .\nit is important to assess water flow , so that waste is constantly discharged from the area .\nthe concentration of parasite forms in swine production wastewater is associated with handling practices and facilities .\nchanges in the raising system reduce infection rates , but the agents can persist even in properties with good

is done using oral fenbendazole , and all animals are kept in a cemented area without access to soul , receiving only commercial feed .\ntherefore , helminth resistance in herds is associated with contamination and environment resistance by the eggs of these helminths . in the inflow ,\nthe number of ascaris suum eggs found in system i ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 eggs  l , averaging 2.5 eggs  l overall for system i. in the effluent of the two stage uasb reactors of system i , lower counts were obtained , averaging 0.027 to 0.107 eggs  l , with removal efficiency between 96.44 and 99.11% in

the uasb reactor and anaerobic filter ,\nno ascaris suum eggs were found , showing high efficiency of that combination in the removal of these organisms , as shown in figure 8 .\ncavalcante , working with anaerobic filters treating domestic sewage , obtained 99% removal efficiency for helminth eggs , resulting in a final effluent with values lower than 1 egg  l. in the treatment of domestic sewage , passamani et al .  \nobtained an efficiency of 87.5% in uasb reactor ( effluent with 24 eggs l ) , whereas no helminth eggs were detected in the effluent from biological filter placed in series , therefore achieving 100% removal efficiency , similar to those obtained in this work .\nthe variation in the number of eggs found in uasb effluents compared to other authors is quite significant .\nzerbini et al .   and souza   presented , respectively , a total of 195 and 229.9 eggs  l , values much higher than those obtained in this study . with regard to the mean values obtained , the observed results are within the range presented in works of cavalcante   and passamani , averaging 0.65 and zero helminth eggs  l respectively . in the anaerobic reactors of treatment systems i and ii , the highest helminth removal efficiencies occurred with higher hrt in assays 1 , 2 , and 3 . with the marked decrease in hrt in assay 4 ,\nthe lowest helminth removals were caused principally by the reduction in the uasb reactor ( r2 ) and in the af of treatment systems i and ii , in which hrts were 4.5 and 5.2  h , respectively , as shown in figures 7 and 8 .\nleopoldino et al . , working with anaerobic filters to treat domestic sewage , observed a final effluent with means below 1 egg  l , with 83.3% removal of helminth eggs .\negg size and density favour the removal by physical processes such as filtration and sedimentation , which are phenomena observed in anaerobic filters .\nthe obtained efficiency results of 99.11% and 100% for treatment systems i and ii , respectively , were considered excellent in ascaris suum eggs removal , meeting the health recommendations of the who for unrestricted use of the effluent for irrigation .\na large number of ascaris suum eggs were found in the sludge blanket in the uasb reactors from treatment systems i and ii a like 0.94 to 7.55  g  ts ; in the bed , the egg count was higher , reaching values of 1.74 to 9.55  g  ts . of the analyzed samples ,\nthe highest concentrations were detected in the bed of the uasb in all assays and in the interstitial sludge from fixed bed of af in assays 1 and 2 .\nthe results obtained both in treatment system i and in treatment system ii were above 0.25 egg g  ts in all assays , and consequently the sludge must be classified as type b according to conama 375 , for which the threshold must be below 10 eggs g  ts and use is restricted , as shown in table 8 .\nthis study indicates that there is a tendency for eggs to be retained or settle onto the bed of the uasb reactor and be retained by adsorption in the biofilm formed in the support medium and the interstitial sludge from fixed bed of the af and tf reactors , as they were found in low amounts or were not detected in the samples from the effluents . in biological sludge\nwe can find several different pathogenic microorganisms ; however , the mere presence of an infectious agent in the sludge used in agriculture does not necessarily imply immediate transmission of diseases ; it only characterizes a potential risk .\nthe real risk of infection for any individual actually depends on the combination of a series of factors , including resistance by pathogenic organisms against wastewater treatment and environmental conditions , infectious dose , pathogenicity , susceptibility and degree of immunity of the host , and degree of human exposure to outbreaks .\nthus , in order for a microorganism present in an effluent used in agriculture to cause disease , it has to resist against the treatment processes employed and survive against the environment in sufficient numbers to infect a susceptible individual .\nthe results obtained in this research are of great importance for health and environmental engineering , as they evidence the importance of combined systems ( anaerobic and aerobic ) , as a technology is capable of having a significant beneficial impact on publish health , by removing helminth eggs .\nthe removal of helminth eggs by the treatment systems was excellent , with 99.11% removal efficiency for system i and 100% for system ii , showing values below 1 egg  l and meeting the health recommendations set by the who for unrestricted use of effluent in irrigation .\ncoliform counts in the effluents of the treatment systems revealed a high potential of coliform removal , reaching percentage values of 99.51% for system i and 99,91% for system ii , which resulted in final effluents with concentrations in the range of 1.00e + 04 to 1.00e + 07 mpn ( 100  ml ) .\nthe high concentrations of this parameter make the agricultural reuse possible only for restricted irrigation ( grains , industrial crops , forage species , pastures , and trees ) .\nwhen evaluated separately , the reactors showed lower removal efficiency for coliforms and helminth eggs than when analyzed as a system of reactors placed in series , evidencing the advantage of anaerobic reactor placed in

{"article":"preeclampsia is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality which complicates approximately 3% of all pregnancies .\nalthough several theories including abnormal placentation , cardiovascular maladaptation to pregnancy , genetic and immune mechanisms , increased systemic inflammatory response , and nutritional , hormonal , and angiogenic factors have been suggested to cause preeclampsia , the etiology of this serious disorder is still unclear.[37 ] compared to women with normal pregnancy , preeclamptic women have a significantly greater systemic inflammatory response .\ninfection is considered as an important source of inflammation that may play a role in many adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia.[911 ] infection can either increase the risk of acute uteroplacental atherosis , and therefore initiate preeclampsia , or amplify the maternal systemic inflammatory response , and consequently potentiate preeclampsia . according to the suggested association between infection and preeclampsia , periodontal infection , which is one of the most common chronic infectious disorders in humans ,\nmight be linked to preeclampsia.[101416 ] depending on the definition of periodontal disorders and the population , the prevalence of periodontal disorders is reported to be between 10% and 60% .\ntherefore , some studies suggest an association between preeclampsia and periodontitis , and some believe that periodontal pathogens may be present in the placenta of women with preeclampsia.[81720 ] however , it is still controversial due to some claims that deny such association . given the above evidence and the controversy on this topic , this study was aimed to investigate the presence of periopathogenic bacteria in the placental tissue of

considered when a woman had hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm hg or a systolic pressure of at least 140 mm hg ) after 20 week of gestation plus proteinuria ( urinary excretion of > 300 mg protein\/24 h , or two random urine specimens obtained at least 4 h apart demonstrating 1+by dipstick testing or measured as > 30 mg protein per desyliter ) .\nwomen who underwent cesarean

clinical features of patients including age , parity , gravidity , and gestational age at delivery were recorded . besides these , the labor phase at the time of delivery and the status of membranes were registered . after the cesarean section ,\nfour placental samples were taken from both central and marginal areas of each placenta by a single physician under sterile condition .\ntwo samples

earlier was almost similar to this study .\nthey found significantly higher frequency of infected placental samples in the preeclampsia group compared with healthy women .\ngingivalis , a. actinomycetemcomitans , pr . intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum in placenta , barak et al . suggested that these pathogens may have transmitted hematogenously and played a role in the formation of

the five investigated types of periopathogenic bacteria were found in both case and control groups of our study , barak et al\n. found all types in the case group and only three types in the control group .\nthese dissimilarities between what we found and the findings of barak et al . could be attributed to some factors , including racial and socioeconomic differences .\nfor instance , the difference could be caused by different levels of oral hygiene of the studied women .\nin other words , it could be supposed that women who were investigated in the barak , et al .\nstudy had better average level of oral hygiene than ours , so the difference between women with good oral hygiene and those with poor oral hygiene has been more prominent and has led to significant differences between the two groups .\nhowever , it is just a hypothesis , not a definite reason , because we do not have any idea about the baseline level of oral hygiene of patients , either from our study or from the barak , et al .\nthe important finding which could be helpful in interpretation of what we found is that swati et al .\nhad detected periopathogenic bacteria in the placenta of two cases who did not have periodontal diseases .\nthis finding shows that having infected placenta with periopathogenic bacteria does not necessarily mean having periodontitis . it was suggested that these pathogens might have gained access to the placenta through the genital tract as an ascending infection , or they might have been translocated retrogradely from the peritoneal cavity through the fallopian tubes .\nbased on this condition , general hygiene could also play an important role in this regard , and can affect the probability of having placental infection with periopathogenic bacteria in the absence of periodontitis .\nthis emphasizes the role of socioeconomic status in the presence of periopathogenic bacteria in the placenta .\nthey defined the clinical criteria for periodontitis , and then assessed the relationship between periodontitis and preeclampsia after controlling the confounders .\nthey believe that maternal infections such as periodontitis accelerate cytokine release and endothelial dysfunction , which increase the risk of preeclampsia.[182325 ] the main difference between our study and the study of siqueira , et al .\nis that we investigated the local effects of periodontitis on the placenta of preeclamptic women , while they investigated the systemic effects of periodontitis on preeclampsia .\ntherefore , although we did not find any evidence that supports the role of placental infection with periopathogenic bacteria , we are not able to rule out the suggested association between preeclampsia and periodontitis at this stage .\nanother study on a relatively large number of jordanian women investigated the association between periodontal parameters and preeclampsia , and reported no association between them .\nsuggested that differences in study design , sample size , periodontal disease definition , and adjustment criteria may be the reasons of their findings .\nin summary , our study did not show any significant difference between preeclamptic women and healthy women with normal pregnancy regarding the periopathogenic bacterial profile of the placenta .\nwe suggest further investigations on larger sample size with better control of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status , accompanied by simultaneous assessment of periodontal parameters to achieve more accurate results .","abstract":" background :

{"article":"local anesthetic injection is the most anxiety - provoking procedure for children.1 injection also produces the greatest negative response in children.2 pain and anxiety can reduce the efficacy of anesthesia in pediatric patients.3 inferior mandibular nerve block is the technique of choice for treatment of mandibular primary molars.2 however , the mandibular nerve block technique has some disadvantages for children such as a higher percentage of post - operative trauma ( lip and tongue biting)4 - 6 and increased risk of trismus7 and positive aspiration that occurs in 10 - 15% cases.8 facial nerve palsy is a complication of inferior alveolar nerve block anesthesia.9 considering the side effects of the mandibular nerve block technique , periodontal ligament ( pdl ) injection can be considered as an alternative.10,11 this technique is simple and seems to provide adequate pain control without an extended period of post - operative anesthesia .\nthis technique also requires very small quantities of anesthetic solution.2 results of study showed 91\/5% effectiveness for restorative procedures when pdl injection was used .\nthe success rate of this technique was 66\/6% for crown preparation and 50% for endodontic procedures.9 another study also reported a 92% success rate for pulpal anesthesia with this technique.12 results of a study showed that the success rate of pdl injection for restorative treatment , pulpotomy and extraction is 91\/46%.13 because mandibular block has some side effects , and pdl injection has some advantages , it makes sense to evaluate the effectiveness of pdl injection in anesthetizing of mandibular primary molars .\nthe purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of pdl injection in the anesthesia of primary molar pulpotomy with mandibular block .\nthis study was conducted at the dental clinic of shahed university from september to december 2011 .\nthe study was performed using sequential double - blind randomized trial . based on a pilot study and a previous study\n80 children aged between 3 and 7 years who required pulpotomy ( based on pre - operative radiograph and clinical signs ) on symmetrical mandibular primary molars were selected and entered in the study sequentially .\nthese children were healthy and did not have any contra indications for local anesthesia and were cooperative ( 3,4 frankle classification ) .\nall children participating in the study were treated by the same operator . in each child who did not have any disease and contra indication for local anesthesia and was not uncooperative ( 1,2 frankle classification ) .\na primary molar on one side randomly received a nerve block injection and its symmetrical tooth received pdl injection randomly .\nrandom allocation ( using a coin ) was done by the dental assistant who was instructed for this duty and was not informed about the study design .\ntopical anesthetic was applied before injection in both techniques . in the mandibular nerve block technique approximately 1\/3 and 0\/5 ml of an esthetic solution2 ( persocain e , lidocain hcl darupakhsh pharmaceutical mfa co. , iran )\nwas placed near the inferior alveolar nerve and in the muco buccal fold ( aesculap syringe , made in usa , niddle : nik rahnama karco , made in iran , 27g- short ( 0.4 - 25 mm ) , respectively . in the pdl technique ,\n0.2 ml of anesthetic solution was placed in the bottom of the middle part of the buccal gingival sulcus until blanching of the buccal tissue was observed . at the time of injection ,\nsigns of discomfort included eye movement , hand and body tension , the verbal complaint and crying ( sem scale).13 these were evaluated after 3 min in the pdl injection group ( because onset of anesthesia after pdl injection is faster than mandibular block ) and after 5 min in the block group by a single rater who was not the surgeon and was blinded to group allocation .\nfinally , the data were analyzed using the exact fisher test and pearson chi - square exact test .\nthe results of this investigation were derived from a sample population comprising 41 female ( the samples were selected randomly ) and 39 males .\nin the inferior alveolar nerve block group , two patients ( one 4-year - old and one 6-year - old ; both of the teeth were e ) exhibited hand and body tension . verbal complaint was seen in four cases ( one 7-year - old , two 4-year - olds , and\none 5-year - old ; 1 of the teeth was d and three were e ) and crying was seen in one patient ( 4-year - old ; the tooth was an e ) . in the pdl injection group ,\ntwo patients ( one 3-year - old and one 4-year - old ; one tooth was d , and one was e ) exhibited hand and body tension .\nverbal complaint was seen in six patients ( three 5-year - olds , one 3-year - old and two 4-year - olds ; the teeth were two d and four e ) and crying was observed in one case ( a 3-year - old ; the tooth was e ) .\nbased on the results of this study success rate was 88\/75 and 91\/25 in the pdl injection and nerve block groups , respectively .\nthere was no statistically significant difference between the two techniques ( p = 0.250 ) .\nthe pearson chi - square exact test showed that there was not a significant difference in pain based on the patient s age and gender between the two groups ( p = 0.250 ) .\nthe fisher exact test showed that there was not a significant difference in pain between the first and second primary molar ( p=0.250 ) .\nwhen anesthesia is not successful , pain during dental treatment is tormenting.14,15 unfortunately approximately 11.6% of children aged 26 - 155 months experience insufficient levels of anesthesia during dental procedures.16 this may be due to the child s age and gender17 - 19 anxiety about injection15,20 the kind of anesthetic agent administered21,22 the operative procedure performed16,17 the use of nitrous oxide \/ oxygen analgesia and oral sedation23 whether they are arch treated16 - 18 and method of local anesthetic administration.5 when the tooth is clinically normal , the success rate of inferior nerve block has been reported to be approximately 75 - 90% or more.24 furthermore , deeper penetration of the needle causes more discomfort and access to the injection area can be difficult.5 pdl injection is an easy technique that probably produces adequate anesthesia for primary molar pulpotomy.25 in this study , we evaluated the effectiveness of pdl injection as primary injection not as adjunctive compared with mandibular block in the pulpotomy of primary molars . in pdl technique\n, we injected an anesthetic agent into the middle of the sulcus on the buccal surface and observed gingival blanching and high success rate of this technique in the present study can be related to this point .\nthese results indicate that the pdl injection is an effective technique for performing pulpotomy on a primary molar . according to results of this study , pdl injection was effective in 88\/75% of all cases .\nthe results of malamed s study showed that pdl injection is 50% effective for endodontic treatment , and these results do not agree with our results .\nhe used this technique on eight teeth and pointed out that the sample size he used was small for endodontic procedures and that additional research must be done.9 in this study injection of an anesthetic agent was done into the middle of the sulcus on the buccal surface , and gingival blanching was observed .\nit is probable that the differences between the results of our study and malamed s stem from this key difference .\nfurthermore , anatomical position of primary molars and bone density in the primary dentition can affect on the success rate of pdl injection in the present study .\nwalton and abbott reported a 92% success rate for this technique.12 the results of his study are in accordance with those of our study .\nhowever , walton evaluated the effectiveness of pdl injection in all teeth ( anterior and posterior ) in both the maxilla and mandible and found that the technique is least effective in mandibular molars.12 we compared the effectiveness of anesthetizing mandibular primary molars with mandibular block and pdl injection in pulpotomy procedures and believe that our study is more accurate than walton s study .\na study by haghgoo found that the success rate of periodontal injection for the pulpotomy of mandibular primary molars ( 30 cases ) was 83\/4%.13 the results of our study are similar to hers .\nhowever , the sample size in our study was more than in haghgoo s and the age range in our study was smaller .\nanother study by naidu et al . compared the effectiveness of the mandibular block \/ long buccal with infiltration \/ intra papillary for pulpotomy and stainless steel crown placement in lower primary molars.26 results of this study showed that there was no difference in the effectiveness of pain control between infiltration \/ intra papillary injection and inferior alveolar nerve block \/ long buccal infiltration .\nhowever , naidu et al . compared infiltration \/ intra papillary injection and inferior alveolar nerve block \/ long buccal infiltration for pulpotomy and stainless steel crown placement in lower primary molars and in present study effectiveness of pdl injection and block injection have been compared .\noztas et al . compared children s reactions to inferior alveolar nerve injection with a traditional syringe and pdl injection with a computerized device ( wand ) and found that immediately after injection the traditional syringe was more painful than injections and pain scores with the wand were significantly higher than those with traditional inferior alveolar nerve injections at the end of the recovery.27 the results of oztas et al .\nstudy contra lateral primary mandibular second molars were treated in two separate visits , and the differences in the results of these two studies may be a result of differences in methods and materials .\nthe results of the present study indicate that there was no significant difference in pain between first and second primary molars .\nstudies generally compared effectiveness of pdl injection in mandibular first and second primary molars . in pdl injection\n, an anesthetic agent is injected into the bottom of the gingival sulcus and this area is similar to the mandibular first and second primary molars .\nthis technique provides reliable pain control rapidly and only requires very small quantities of anesthetic solution.2 in the present studied we investigated the effectiveness of pdl injection in the anesthesia of primary molar pulpotomy with mandibular block .\nit is recommend that the effectiveness of pdl injection will be studied in dental treatment including pulp treatment and restoration and extraction of maxillary molars and incisors .\nbased on the results of this study , pdl injection can be used for pulpotomy of mandibular primary molars .","abstract":" background : inferior alveolar nerve block is a common technique for anesthesia of the primary mandibular molars . a number of disadvantages have been shown

The distance between the inferior alveolar foramen and the upper border of the mandibular second premolars is approximately 25-30 mm. This distance can vary depending on jaw size, muscle size and contraction, and bone density. The alveolar nerve lies within the canal from the upper border of the mandibular second premolar to the upper border of the first mandibular molar.\nPalpate along the alveolar nerve canal 1-2 mm from the teeth, until the nerve is found and the needle tip is inserted into the buccal tissue below.\nThe needle tip is inserted into the buccal tissue below the apex of the mandibular molar and directed down towards the occlusal of the mandible. The needle should not be directed toward the lower border of the mandible since the mandible in children is smaller and can move with the needle. If there is any resistance, the needle should be turned 45\u00b0 at the entry point. Once the needle tip enters the mandibular bone, the needle should be advanced to the alveolar nerve. The injection should be slightly more difficult than a dental injection with a small rubber dam or a tongue depressor. If the buccal tissue impedes the injection, the needle can be advanced slightly deeper into the mandibular bone.\nWith the needle tip in the nerve (1-2 mm above the mandibular first premolar) withdraw the needle, pull the skin taut, and inject local anesthetic 1 ml. If bleeding occurs, the needle should be advanced slightly.\nThe inferior alveolar nerve block provides anesthesia for buccal extractions and should decrease the stress induced by the injection of local anesthetic. The injection should be done as early as possible in order to increase the effectiveness and to allow enough time to administer any anti-inflammatory or pain medication that is prescribed to the patient.\nThe patient may experience post-procedural pain in the mandibular foramen or within the mandibular second premolar tooth. If the injection is painful, give 0.75-1.0 ml of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication intra-orally immediately after the injection.\nPediatric patients often complain of lingering pain after the buccal anesthetic injection. These patients may benefit from the administration of an anti-inflammatory drug"}

It is a common diagnosis in the neurologic examination and is very treatable.\nTreatment has to be individualized. In children, symptoms may resolve spontaneously within a few weeks; in adults, symptoms may persist for months to years. Surgical resection is sometimes helpful, but it is not always effective and must not be pursued if there is marked depression or impairment of the ability to blink or close the eyes.\nEyelid tremor or blepharoclonus may be a symptom of the following health conditions:\nEye twitching (blepharospasm) is a common condition in which individuals experience uncontrolled, rapid blinking. This eyelid movement can be very sudden and involuntary, and it is often associated with symptoms such as burning, irritation, and tearing of the eyes. It is not a health risk.\nThis condition can occur at any age, but it is most commonly seen in young or middle-aged adults. One theory regarding the cause of blepharospasm suggests that it can be linked to emotional stress. According to this theory, individuals whose emotional state is stressful are more likely to have this type of eyelid movement.\nIn more than half of the cases of blepharospasm that occur, no specific cause can be identified. When there is no apparent trigger, the condition is known as \"idiopathic blepharospasm\" or \"idiopathic blepharospasm.\" It can occur at any age, but it is typically seen in people between the ages of 30 to 65 years. In some cases, it may be associated with stress, although there is not a lot of research to support that theory.\nIf you suspect that you have this type of eyelid movement, make an appointment to discuss the condition with your eye doctor. He or she may ask some questions about your symptoms and may examine you to try to determine a cause. In some cases, an examination will reveal no reason for the movement, so treatment may not be needed. If there is a suspected cause, however, treatment for blepharospasm may help to decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of the disorder.\nTreatment for blepharospasm is usually aimed at reducing symptoms without having to alter the underlying condition that is causing the eyelid movement. A variety of drugs are commonly used to treat eyelid movements that are idiopathic.\nTreatment may include the use of topical medication"}

another study that examined nses impacts on survival in leukemia patients aged 039 only found a significant gradient in survival among 3039 year - olds . an investigation on survival in nhl patients in scotland and wales found 10% and 19% shorter survival in intermediate and most deprived areas , respectively , .\nthe study used an area - level deprivation score based on four census variables ( car ownership , male unemployment , overcrowding , and social class ) .\nrace and ethnicity were not reported in the scottish study , perhaps because health research on racial \/ ethnic differences in survival is less widely conducted in the uk . if the study sample was fairly homogenously caucasian , the results would be consistent with our findings of an nses gradient in survival among non - hispanic whites . not finding an ses - mortality gradient in the non - white patients in our study raises several questions about the cancer experience in these populations .\nfirst , it is important to reiterate that for nhbs and hls , although the unadjusted hazard ratios for both acm and lsm were significantly higher than for nhws , adjustment for the other factors in the model  including nses , stage at diagnosis , and first - course treatment  attenuated these risks . as evident in figure 1 , there were far more nhbs and hls residing in poorer nses areas , which often have lower access to resources .\nthus , it is possible the differences in survival by race \/ ethnicity commonly reported may be due more to confounding by later initiation of and poorer access to care , a phenomenon noted in hispanic populations     .\nmeasuring access to care is quite difficult , particularly in a registry - based analysis , and further studies should be done to examine why a gradient exists for nhws but not other racial \/ ethnic groups .\ndifferential access to the most effective treatment regimens may still persist for lower ses groups .\nthe lack of a consistent association between health insurance status and survival after adjustment was surprising , given the widely - documented increased vulnerability of patients lacking health insurance .\nfinding higher all - cause mortality among those with government - provided insurance compared to those without insurance suggests that there may be important disparities in access to care among medicaid recipients . approximately double the percentage ( 17.8% ) of those without health insurance\ncompared to those with government - provided health insurance ( 9.4% ) resided in the highest nses quintile at diagnosis .\na paper analyzing the relationship of health insurance status and cancer outcomes across us demographic groups found striking disparities in cancer screening , stage at diagnosis , and survival for those uninsured or insured by medicare or medicaid     .\nindividuals in the general population aged 1824 were also found to have the highest probability of lacking insurance or being insufficiently insured .\naccess to adequate healthcare coverage can affect cancer care , including challenges of covering premiums , deductibles , and co - payments , and difficulty remaining employed and eligible for insurance benefits     [ 19 , 29 ] .\none study found an average increase of 13.1 weeks in wait time between diagnosis and initiation of treatment for non- or government - insured patients as compared to private health insurance , although no associations between wait times and ses , gender , age , race \/ ethnicity , or marital status were found     .\none of the strengths of this study is the use of ccr data with a large , heterogeneous , and population - based cohort with almost complete patient ascertainment and follow - up .\nregistry - based explorations of factors that contribute to longer survival are important to help identify groups that are particularly vulnerable to premature cancer mortality . because social determinants affect health outcomes along several pathways , it is important to document the existence of persistent health disparities , particularly for understudied groups such as ayas . the limitations of this study include the estimation of ses based on the residence at diagnosis , which may not accurately capture some factors that contribute to healthy living environments and adequate medical care .\ntransitioning through developmental life stages can make ayas a heterogeneous group ; some are dependent on parents and relatives while others provide for families of their own . as such , measuring ses as a one - time neighborhood composite variable may inadequately summarize an individual patient 's social and financial circumstances     .\nthe way that first course of treatment is measured in the registry is also somewhat limited ;

However, lymphomas are   the   second leading cause of cancer death in this age group, trailing only lung   cancer ( ). Thus, early recognition and treatment of lymphomas in this age group is critical for optimal clinical outcomes. The pathologic diagnosis of lymphomas in adolescence and young adulthood   relies heavily on the use of needle aspiration and biopsy to obtain specimens. (This is in stark contrast to pediatric lymphomas, where surgical resection can help distinguish low-risk from high-risk diagnoses,   and to   pediatric   lymphoma . ) As discussed in the   pathophysiology section, however, the pathologic diagnosis of lymphomas can be challenging in young adults. Because of the clinical importance of accurate diagnosis, it is critical that the clinician understands the anatomic site and type of the initial lymphoma, which will dictate subsequent management options. Lymphomas frequently arise from a single affected lymph node ( ) ( Fig. 17. 17.1 ); however, when patients present with multiple or non-anatomical lymphadenopathy, a lymphadenopathy-based lymphoma diagnosis is preferred to make the initial diagnosis. (This is important because some anatomic locations may predispose the patient to developing an   indolent, high-grade lymphoma, or   a reactive   process .) The initial   diagnosis of lymphoma in adults relies on three components. First, lymphadenopathy is the clinical hallmark . Second, the affected lymph node will be of a specific anatomic location ( e.g., cervical, upper extremity, supraclavicular, mediastinal, axillary), and, third, will have specific findings on physical exam and\/or imaging. All three of these components can guide the pathologist to the correct diagnosis; however, the specific type and location of the lymphoma   can sometimes be challenging to identify even with the best clinical suspicion. The second edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for lymphomas was published in 2015 ( ). In this system, lymphomas are divided into five major types according to their morphological features: nodular sclerosis and follicular lymphomas, which are classified as indolent lymphoma; small lymphocytic and lymphoblastic lymphomas, which are classified as intermediate grade lymphoma; and diffuse large B-cell, T-cell, and natural killer-cell lymphomas, which are classified as high-grade lymphomas.

{"article":"a large body of the recent psychiatric literature is questioning the empirical value of current prescribing habits as well as the psychiatrists choice of medication selection as increasing amounts of polypharmacy and risk of medications creep into patients regimes.112 without better evidence - based research , often medication choices are made by trial and error , leading to significant delays to effective treatment .\nthere is little empirical evidence supporting the benefits of polypharmacy , and continuing a trial - and - error approach to the implementation of psychotropic medications .\nthis is discussed in a recently published paper1 in which polypharmacy is compared to washing patients out of their current medication as a possible next step in medication management . in the newly reported combining medication to enhance depression outcomes\nstudy,13 a national institutes of health ( nih)-funded research to determine whether starting several antidepressants at the same time would be associated with increased efficacy , no significant difference between the response or remission rates were observed .\nthis large , well - designed study supports the contention that psychiatry is still in need of evidence - based tools to orient psychotropic treatment selection .\nthis same conclusion was highlighted by recent programmatic documents of the national institute of mental health ( nimh ) , which highlighted the need for objective evidence - based neuroscience1417 instruments in addition to diagnoses based on symptom clusters in selecting the most effective treatments .\nadditionally , reports from the large nih - funded sequence treatment alternatives to relieve depression ( star*d ) study,18 as well as other publications,19,20 have revealed the lack of biomarkers and the limitations of relying on symptom -

emergent side effects or more specifically to predict treatment - emergent suicidal ideation.21,22 there is ample previous evidence for the qeeg - based treatment outcomes in the literature .\nsuffin and emory,23 through referenced -

rated medications were associated with severe adverse effects 50% of the time .\ntable 3 shows both studies along with the rating on the drug causing the significant adverse side effect .\none drug in the chart review had insufficient information in the database to be included .\nthe pooled results were statistically significant assuming an equal distribution across r \/ i \/ s categories as the null hypothesis .\nthe medications prescribed based on review of the qeeg data contained in the current version of the referenced - eeg database and peer report were from four different classes , ie , anticonvulsants , antidepressants , stimulants ( which included monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to their stimulating effect on the eeg and the way the database classifies them ) , and beta - blockers .\npatients were treated with either monotherapy or combinations of medications guided by the four categories listed in the peer report . clinical judgment always superseded data from the report as the peer report offers more data to incorporate into the clinical decisionmaking process and is not meant as a stand - alone cookbook for psychotropic medications . since not all medications are part of the current version of the database , substitutions were allowed in the following instances : duloxetine for venlafaxine ; oxcarbazepine for carbamazepine ; and lisdexamphetamine for dextroamphetamine .\nour chart review was not designed to define us food and drug administration ( fda ) labeling , nor was it intended to encourage such prescribing habits . due to this concern\nwe examined the amount of off - label prior drug - use in this population as well as the literature and found a paucity of evidence for most off - label prescribing . when having to decide on changing or adding a medication , factoring in polypharmacy risks and benefits unfortunately is done with inadequate information .\nthe large degree of off - label prescribing should be done with as much data as is available to the prescriber in order to optimize safety and outcome .\nthis secondary analysis was performed to help address this possible criticism of off - label prescribing since it is done with such frequency and insufficient evidence .\npeer has the potential to enhance the information available to the prescriber when making these difficult decisions , thus offering some objectivity to off - label usage .\nradley et al41 wrote about off - label medication - prescribing , placing psychiatric medications as one of the most frequently prescribed at 31% .\nyury et al42 found that there is no published data for 40% of the most popular augmentation strategies and 55% of frequent combination of medications for augmentation .\nadditionally , an agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) report43 reviewing the top off - label use of medications according to such factors as risk , cost , side effects , and drug interactions , revealed 17 of them to be psychotropic . of those studied , 65% had inadequate evidence for off - label prescribing ( ie , quetapine , clonazepam , escitalopram , lorazepam , trazodone , zolpidem , sertraline , bupropion , venlafaxine , duloxetine , aripiprazole ) .\nthe remaining 35% ( ie , gabapentin , risperidone , amitriptyline , olanzapine , devalproex , lamotrigine ) averaged 12.5% adequate evidence , 33.2% uncertain evidence , and 54.3% inadequate evidence . in another ahrq report on off - label use of atypical antipsychotic medications , it concluded that , with few exceptions , there was not enough evidence to consider the off - label use of these drugs and that the increased risk of adverse events was concerning.44 we used our own data to perform a review of all the drugs labeling and dates of approval , using the fda s website for each medication and approval date for each diagnosis . the date used for the prescribing date of previous medications was \nprior to 2003 ,  the beginning date of the review , since patient history of medications start \/ stop dates is frequently unreliable .\nthis analysis revealed that 62% of previously prescribed psychotropic medications were offlabel at the time of their prescription date .\nthis assessment leaves many variables not accounted for , such as what previous diagnosis the patient had received at the time the drug was prescribed , which might be different than the diagnosis determined in our clinic or what the patient reported .\nwe are not implying any relationship between off - label prescribing and the medications used by peer guidance .\nrather , since there is an abundance of off - label psychotropic medication - prescribing , such prescribing , with more evidenced - based information , can decrease risks and increase success , according to the results of this review . despite the evidence of increased safety and efficacy in this and previous studies,2130\nthere are several limitations inherent in this retrospective chart review that may limit the conclusions one can draw from a case series .\nfirst , the peer report was initially established as a predictor of future treatment success .\nat this point we are not able to separate the role of peer in selecting the most efficacious treatments from the selection of better - tolerated treatments ( since , many times , poorly tolerated treatments are abandoned in clinical practice and ultimately not efficacious ) .\nhowever , it is comforting to see that peer reports appear to be associated with effective and well - tolerated medication choices .\nsecond , while this review did not systematically benefit from research - ready data , our analyses suggest overall improvement on both cgi - i and q - les - q - sf global scales after peer .\nthird , there was no comparison group in this study so it is not clear what the effects of treatment would have been in a parallel cohort of subjects not utilizing the peer analysis .\nhowever , some information is provided by comparing our results with the patients pre -

label prescribing should be done with as much data as is available to the prescriber in order to optimize safety and outcome .\nthis secondary analysis was performed to help address this possible criticism of off - label prescribing since it is done with such frequency and insufficient evidence .\npeer has the potential to enhance the information available to the prescriber when making these difficult decisions , thus offering some objectivity to off - label usage .\nradley et al41 wrote about off - label medication - prescribing , placing psychiatric medications as one of the most frequently prescribed at 31% .\nyury et al42 found that there is no published data for 40% of the most popular augmentation strategies and 55% of frequent combination of medications for augmentation . additionally , an agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) report43 reviewing the top off - label use of medications according to such factors as risk , cost , side effects , and drug interactions , revealed 17 of them to be psychotropic .\nof those studied , 65% had inadequate evidence for off - label prescribing ( ie , quetapine , clonazepam , escitalopram , lorazepam , trazodone , zolpidem , sertraline , bupropion , venlafaxine , duloxetine , aripiprazole ) .\nthe remaining 35% ( ie , gabapentin , risperidone , amitriptyline , olanzapine , devalproex , lamotrigine ) averaged 12.5% adequate evidence , 33.2% uncertain evidence , and 54.3% inadequate evidence . in another ahrq report on off - label use of atypical antipsychotic medications , it concluded that , with few exceptions , there was not enough evidence to consider the off - label use of these drugs and that the increased risk of adverse events was concerning.44 we used our own data to perform a review of all the drugs labeling and dates of approval , using the fda s website for each medication and approval date for each diagnosis . the date used for the prescribing date of previous medications was \nprior to 2003 ,  the beginning date of the review , since patient history of medications start \/ stop dates is frequently unreliable .\nthis analysis revealed that 62% of previously prescribed psychotropic medications were offlabel at the time of their prescription date .\nthis assessment leaves many variables not accounted for , such as what previous diagnosis the patient had received at the time the drug was prescribed , which might be different than the diagnosis determined in our clinic or what the patient reported .\nwe are not implying any relationship between off - label prescribing and the medications used by peer guidance . rather , since there is an abundance of off - label psychotropic medication - prescribing , such prescribing , with more evidenced - based information , can decrease risks and increase success , according to the results of this review .\ndespite the evidence of increased safety and efficacy in this and previous studies,2130 there are several limitations inherent in this retrospective chart review that may limit the conclusions one can draw from a case series .\nfirst , the peer report was initially established as a predictor of future treatment success . at this point\nwe are not able to separate the role of peer in selecting the most efficacious treatments from the selection of better - tolerated treatments ( since , many times , poorly tolerated treatments are abandoned in clinical practice and ultimately not efficacious ) .\nhowever , it is comforting to see that peer reports appear to be associated with effective and well - tolerated medication choices .\nsecond , while this review did not systematically benefit from research - ready data , our analyses suggest overall improvement on both cgi - i and q - les - q - sf global scales after peer .\nthird , there was no comparison group in this study so it is not clear what the effects of treatment would have been in a parallel cohort of subjects not utilizing the peer analysis .\nhowever , some information is provided by comparing our results with the patients pre - peer experience ( ie , treatment failure ) and historic data , making each patient s pre \/ post results their own control .\nfourth , this is a cohort of persons who could afford the costs ( despite the compassionate sliding scale offered ) associated with the eeg test , and thus these patients may not be representative of all similar patients .\nfifth , not all available medications are in the current version of the database , leading to potential limitations . however , this would reduce our ability to detect a benefit with peer reports compared to standard practice ( and increases our confidence in our positive results ) .\nour retrospective chart analysis of clinical cases indicates that peer report using the referenced - eeg database may be a useful metric tool for clinicians making medication recommendations for refractory nonpsychotic patients .\nas this data indicates , peer report may be useful as a negative marker to potentially avoid some risk of severe adverse events and in selecting more efficacious agents in treatmentresistant patients .\nthe results of this review are encouraging and indicate that treating patients with the additional information conveyed by the referenced - eeg database and peer report may result in better treatment responses in a group of patients who had not previously responded to trial - and - error medication selection ( currently considered standard practice ) .\nfor example , the use of stimulants in some patients with obsessive - compulsive disorder , anxiety , or eating disorders without the use of an antidepressant would not be a traditional medication choice , yet in these cases appeared to be what was needed for their particular neurophysiology ( given positive clinical outcomes ) .\nthe potential cost savings as a result of an effective medication regimen suggest that peer analysis may be cost - effective .\nthe durability of response with medications selected according to data provided by this tool and the broader options of medication combinations suggested by data in the report portends well for treatment compliance , number of medication trials , and treatment efficiency .\ngetting a patient on the correct medicine with improvement within a few sessions not only reduces the cost of trial - and - error prescribing , but , more importantly , reduces patient suffering .\nit is also noted that at this point in the development of the database , almost all the medications are generic .\nsimilarly , the use of atypical antipsychotics for the nonpsychotic patient in our clinic is estimated to be significantly lower than the use in practices treating similar patient populations .\nfuture directions for the use of this technology include development of additional drugs and including comparisons with other neuroimaging techniques to address neuroanatomy in addition to clinical correlations .\nmore studies need to be done on the ability to prevent serious adverse events , suicidality , as well as targeting the best medication option for the individualized patient .\nfinally , a separate database is being completed for predicting outcomes of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy as a way of deciding the probability of success when the decision to spend health care dollars needs to be considered .\nfurther research in these areas need to confirm the value of qeeg as a simple , inexpensive , and noninvasive outpatient clinical tool for accuracy , safety , and cost savings .","abstract":" we previously reported on an objective new tool that uses quantitative electroencephalography ( qeeg ) normative- and referenced -

When the patient is well into this psychotherapeutic treatment I would wean off the meds and see if we can manage well without the medication, unless we were in the midst of some severe and immediate crisis situation.\nIn my opinion, the use of antidepressants and antipsychotic agents for anxiety or mood disorders is more questionable as the evidence base for their use has a limited value, the"}

causing mutations were identified in 11 of these , so that they are excellent candidates for identification of new arrd genes residing within linked regions in which no mutations were identified in the known candidate gene . the most promising approach to discover novel genes after such a systematic analysis of many consanguineous families is next - generation sequencing ,\nalthough familial locus heterogeneity or compound heterozygous mutations might explain the phenotype of a small proportion of the families , as intrafamilial locus heterogeneity was detected in 15.3% of the families studied in a recent report of pakistani families with hearing impairment .\nin addition , compound heterozygous mutations were identified in 2.7% of genetically resolved arrd families in a review of all published retinal degeneration cases in pakistan .\nalthough homozygosity mapping has been proven effective , a major limitation is that this type of analysis will overlook familial locus heterogeneity or compound heterozygous mutations . in conclusion ,\nour results provide a key bridge between bench and bedside and should make genetic diagnosis of arrd in patients more accessible and practical .\nthis should greatly enhance the clinical genetic counseling , diagnosis , and early intervention of arrd in the pakistani population .\nthese results also highlight the importance of analyzing the causative genes and their exons in different ethnic groups in a systematic and population - specific fashion .","abstract":" purposethe pakistan punjab population has been a rich source for identifying genes causing or contributing to autosomal recessive retinal degenerations ( arrd ) . \n this study was carried out to delineate the genetic architecture of arrd in the pakistani population.methodsthe genetic origin of arrd in a total of 144 families selected only for having consanguineous marriages and multiple members affected with arrd was examined . of these \n , causative mutations had been identified in 62 families while only the locus had been identified for an additional 15 . \n the remaining 67 families were subjected to homozygosity exclusion mapping by screening of closely flanking microsatellite markers at 180 known candidate genes \/ loci followed by sequencing of the candidate gene for pathogenic changes.resultsof these 67 families subjected to homozygosity mapping , 38 showed homozygosity for at least one of the 180 regions , and sequencing of the corresponding genes showed homozygous cosegregating mutations in 27 families . \n overall , mutations were detected in approximately 61.8 % ( 89\/144 ) of arrd families tested , with another 10.4% ( 15\/144 ) being mapped to a locus but without a gene identified.conclusionsthese results suggest the involvement of unmapped novel genes in the remaining 27.8% ( 40\/144 ) of families . in addition , this study demonstrates that homozygosity mapping remains a powerful tool for identifying the genetic defect underlying genetically heterogeneous arrd disorders in consanguineous marriages for both research and clinical applications .

related bacteria .\nrisk factors associated with device infection are device revision ( e.g. generator change ) and number of pacemaker leads .\nthe reported rate of cardiac device infection throughout the world ranges between 0.85.8  % [ 79 ] . at 1.5  %\npossibly , the aggressive protocol for periprocedural prophylactic antibiotics in patients at high risk for device infection ( mainly in patients with device revisions with additional lead placement , or when procedure durations were longer than 3  h ) could have contributed to this . in general , the high level of experience of operating physicians is associated with lower rates of infection\n. the true infection rate might be even lower , because 13\/31 patients had a primary implantation in the referring hospital .\nthe reported 30-day mortality rate in our study was as low as 3.2  % and 1  year all - cause mortality rates were similar to patients without device infection .\nagain , mortality rates were lower in our present report , in comparison with other reports , which had mortality rates of 7.423  % [ 3 , 1012 ] . in these reports , however , only 841  % of patients underwent complete removal of the device and leads [ 11 , 12 ] .\nthus , our lower mortality rate could be caused by our aggressive approach of fast and complete system removal , preferably percutaneously , with aggressive and prolonged antibiotic treatment .\nrisk factors for device infection were device revision and left ventricular lead placement . in our present report\nwe had expected that in both groups , a higher number of leads would be related to device infection , mainly because of the procedure duration .\ndifferences in clinical characteristics of pacemaker versus icd patients could be of influence in explaining this unexpected finding in our present report . unfortunately , we could not perform multivariate analysis correcting for confounders , due to the low number of endpoints . the exact relation can therefore not be extracted from our database , and to refrain from hypothetical discussion , we decided not to speculate on this .\nmost previous reports indicate that a higher number of previous device procedures is one of the most important risk factors for device infection .\nadditionally , procedure time , pocket haematoma , procedure duration , renal dysfunction , low body mass index , diabetes and steroid use have been reported as risk factors [ 5 , 14 , 15 ] .\nit is at present unknown if prolonged use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients at high risk for device infection reduces the rate of device infection .\nrecently , an antibacterial envelope placed around the device generator in the pocket was developed , possibly further reducing infection rates . in our present study ,\nno significant difference was seen in cardiac device infection rate between device procedures that were performed in the catheterisation lab and the operating room .\npossibly , this can be explained by the fact that most device infections are caused by skin - related micro - organisms , and could be introduced during the postoperative period , or thereafter .\ncaution is needed with interpretation of the device and lead cultures , since there is a chance of contamination which might have led to false - positive cultures .\nthere was an early infection rate ( e.g. < 1 month ) of 23  % .\nit is likely that early infection is caused by primary contamination during the device procedure or in the directly following period .\nfor the device infections that occur in a later time frame , it is not always easy to determine the cause of the infection . in one patient\niatrogenic causes of infection play a role in device infection , but it would be hard to lower the rate of this since it is common practice to give patients prophylactic antibiotics for most surgical procedures .\nsince patients were followed once per 6 months , and we did not actively search for possible device infections between the regular follow - up visits , we could have missed possible patients with a device infection with symptoms not severe enough for the patient to attend to the hospital .\nnot all clinical variables were available for analysis ( e.g. duration of the procedure and incidence of pocket haematoma ) , precluding the possibility to find associations of these variables with device infection .\nanother limitation is the fact that we compared two groups that were possibly not comparable at baseline due to the retrospective design of the study .\nsince patients were followed once per 6 months , and we did not actively search for possible device infections between the regular follow -

range , 4667 years ) underwent a one - sided dorsal oral mucosal graft urethroplasty for penile urethral strictures through the penoscrotal inversion technique .\nthe cause of stricture was previous urethral instrumentation in 2 cases ( 40% ) , lichen sclerosis in 1 case ( 20% ) , and hypospadias in 2 cases ( 40% ) .\nall 5 patients had received previous dilations or urethrotomies ; 2 patients ( the hypospadias patients ) had undergone prior urethroplasties .\nclinical outcome was considered a failure if any postoperative instrumentation was needed , including dilation . in all patients ,\nof the 5 patients , 4 had successful outcomes and 1 had a failed outcome during the follow - up period .\nhe had been performing self - dilation for several years before he researched the penile inversion approach to stricture repair .\nhe was counseled on all the options , including a staged repair given the nature of his stricture ; however , he elected to attempt to undergo the dorsal onlay approach .\nhe developed a penile hematoma that became infected . once the infection was drained and cleared , his catheter was removed , and a distal stricture recurred .\nsurprisingly , the graft was mostly intact , and he was managed with a short 0.5-cm meatotomy .\none patient with a 5-cm lichen sclerosis stricture experienced postoperative chordee that has since resolved .\nthe success of the dorsal onlay technique , using a onesided dissection , for bulbar and panurethral strictures has been well described via a perineal incision .\nthis is the first report of a penoscrotal incision to access the penile urethra for dorsal onlay graft urethroplasties .\nthe potential advantages of this approach will be explored . because the penoscrotal inversion technique allows the patient to stay in the supine position , the complication of neurapraxia is theoretically the same as with any supine surgical procedure . by contrast , if the perineal incision is utilized , the peroneal nerve neurapraxia rate has been reported at 15.8% . in a second study ,\nlower - extremity complications were reported at 10% ; this included a 6.5% neurapraxia rate , a 1% rate of rhabdomyolysis , and a 1% rate of compartment syndrome .\nfor example , whitson et al .   reported a series of 124 patients in low lithotomy with a neurapraxia rate of 3.4% and compartment syndrome seen in only 1 patient ; complications were also noted to increase if the lithotomy position was over 5 hours .\nhowever , with the aforementioned supine approach , then this operation has clear advantages over approaching the stricture through a perineal incision .\nfirst , a patient must void through a proximal urethral defect or empty the bladder via a suprapubic tube after the first stage for some time until the urethra is stable enough for the second stage of repair .\nsecond , a 2-stage repair is associated with a high revision rate . in a recent report on staged urethroplasty\n, only 56% underwent the retubularization procedure , 26% required revision of the first- or second - stage procedure , and the success rate was 90% ( including those who underwent 1-stage repair ) .\nwhile the previous report noted a 90% success rate , others have not noted as much success with staged urethroplasty . a direct comparison between 1-stage buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty and 2-stage urethroplasty for long segment strictures showed a success rate of 83% versus 64% .\nhowever , when the above authors reported their success in patients treated for lichen sclerosis with a 1-stage buccal mucosal repair versus a 2-stage operation , the success favored the 1-stage approach : 86% success versus 52% , respectively .\nfistula can occur in up to 3% to 20% of cases of fasciocutaneous flap urethroplasty   and up to 10% of staged urethroplasty .\npatients who undergo a fasciocutaneous flap experience a higher rate of complications compared to buccal mucosal urethroplasty .\ncomplications include torsion , hematoma , sacculations , penile skin necrosis , complaints of irregular skin elevation , and penile skin scarring .\nadditional complications of 2-stage urethroplasty include 10% wound dehiscence and 5% wound infection or abscess . using a penoscrotal approach limits skin complications of the penile urethra .\none case in our series developed a penile hematoma that converted to an abscess requiring drainage . after this\n, we began to use surgical glue to secure the penile skin over the urethra after the repair was complete .\nsince we started using the glue , we have had no additional cases of hematomas .\nthe few numbers of patients and the short follow - up are clearly the limiting factors of this surgical approach .\nthe idea of a penile inversion has been well described , although not through a penoscrotal approach .\nalthough the advantages listed previously are present , they have not been fully tested with a large number of patients with long - term follow - up .\nnext , for the most complicated urethral strictures , the use of 1-stage urethroplasty is not recommended .\npreviously , lichen sclerosis was included on this list ;

complications were also noted to increase if the lithotomy position was over 5 hours . however , with the aforementioned supine approach , then this operation has clear advantages over approaching the stricture through a perineal incision .\nfirst , a patient must void through a proximal urethral defect or empty the bladder via a suprapubic tube after the first stage for some time until the urethra is stable enough for the second stage of repair .\nsecond , a 2-stage repair is associated with a high revision rate . in a recent report on staged urethroplasty\n, only 56% underwent the retubularization procedure , 26% required revision of the first- or second - stage procedure , and the success rate was 90% ( including those who underwent 1-stage repair ) .\nwhile the previous report noted a 90% success rate , others have not noted as much success with staged urethroplasty . a direct comparison between 1-stage buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty and 2-stage urethroplasty for long segment strictures showed a success rate of 83% versus 64% .\nhowever , when the above authors reported their success in patients treated for lichen sclerosis with a 1-stage buccal mucosal repair versus a 2-stage operation , the success favored the 1-stage approach : 86% success versus 52% , respectively .\nfistula can occur in up to 3% to 20% of cases of fasciocutaneous flap urethroplasty   and up to 10% of staged urethroplasty .\npatients who undergo a fasciocutaneous flap experience a higher rate of complications compared to buccal mucosal urethroplasty .\ncomplications include torsion , hematoma , sacculations , penile skin necrosis , complaints of irregular skin elevation , and penile skin scarring .\nadditional complications of 2-stage urethroplasty include 10% wound dehiscence and 5% wound infection or abscess .\none case in our series developed a penile hematoma that converted to an abscess requiring drainage .\nafter this , we began to use surgical glue to secure the penile skin over the urethra after the repair was complete .\nsince we started using the glue , we have had no additional cases of hematomas .\nthe few numbers of patients and the short follow - up are clearly the limiting factors of this surgical approach .\nthe idea of a penile inversion has been well described , although not through a penoscrotal approach .\nalthough the advantages listed previously are present , they have not been fully tested with a large number of patients with long - term follow - up .\nnext , for the most complicated urethral strictures , the use of 1-stage urethroplasty is not recommended .\npreviously , lichen sclerosis was included on this list ;

{"article":"carcinoma in situ of the breast is defined as abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells that do not trespass the basal membrane of the breast ductal or lobular system and consist of a heterogeneous group with different types of histology and also different prognosis .\nthe incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) has increased significantly in all parts of the world including the netherlands , mainly due to the introduction of breast cancer screening .\nfew treated patients will ultimately die of breast cancer ; however , despite the relatively benign nature of dcis , patients commonly undergo mastectomy [ 24 ] .\nthe risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment have been discussed in several studies [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] .\nnonetheless , some patients with dcis have a less benign course than other patients , and it is still not possible to identify which dcis lesions will progress to invasive carcinoma and in what time interval . besides , although dcis is thought of as an early - stage cancer , lesions can be quite large .\nmost clinical series have focused on the risk of breast cancer recurrence , rather than risk of death per se .\npopulation - based reports of actual deaths from breast cancer in women with dcis are scarce , but show little excess mortality [ 7 , 8 ] .\nthe mass mammographic screening program in the netherlands started in 1990\/1991 for females aged 5070 years ; in 1997 the upper age limit of the screening program was increased to 75 years .\nthe aim of this study was to assess the incidence and treatment of patients with dcis in the netherlands from 1997 to 2005 and to calculate the number of observed deaths versus the number of expected deaths based on the general population to estimate the excess mortality risk of patients diagnosed with dcis .\npalga , the nationwide dutch network and registry of histo- and cytopathology , regularly submits reports of all diagnosed malignancies to the regional cancer registries .\nthe national hospital discharge databank , which receives discharge diagnoses of admitted patients from all dutch hospitals , completes case ascertainment .\ntrained cancer registry personnel collect data on diagnosis , staging , and treatment from the medical records , including pathology and surgery reports , using the registration and coding manual of the dutch association of comprehensive cancer centers .\nall data from the regional cancer registries are merged into the netherlands cancer registry ( ncr ) . from the ncr database ,\nadult female patients with dcis diagnosed between 1997 and 2005 were selected ( n = 8421 ) .\nhistopathology was according to the national protocols in the netherlands ( http:\/\/www.oncoline.nl\/ ) ;

p < 0.001 )\n. for all strata of patients over the age of 50 years who underwent mastectomy , observed and expected mortality were close resulting in a relative mortality of around 1.0 .\noverall , all surgically treated patients aged 50 years and older experienced no excess mortality due to dcis ( ratio of 1.0 ) .\nall ages combined , 704 deaths within 10 years were observed versus 692.1 expected based on the general population with a ratio of 1.0 expressing no excess mortality of dcis in the netherlands .\ndue to the introduction of breast cancer screening , incidence of dcis has increased dramatically in the last years . despite the increasing incidence\nnot many population - based reports are available that report mortality in this group of women .\nthe present population - based study of almost 8500 patients in the netherlands diagnosed between 19972005 shows that excess mortality was observed for patients younger than 50 years .\nhowever , no excess mortality in surgically treated women over 50 years with dcis was observed .\nthis means that after the diagnosis and treatment of dcis the women experienced a similar mortality as age and year matched women in the general population . understanding the care received by women with dcis is important since it is highly curable , its incidence is rising ( from 4.9 ( 1989 ) to 18.6 ( 2008 ) per 100  000 ) , and it is often detected in otherwise healthy women and there is a possibility of overtreatment .\noverall , 45% of the women in the netherlands underwent mastectomy for dcis . in many such patients\n, mastectomy may have been medically appropriate , based on patient preferences or the underlying practice of individual surgeons or institutions .  \nthe reasons for this are unclear , but the result is probably explained by patients who are unfit for surgery due to many comorbidities or patient preferences . although mastectomy results in a cure rate approaching 100% , this may be overtreatment for some patients , particularly those with small , mammographically detected lesions\n. moreover , there are no randomized studies demonstrating that mastectomy is better than conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy for patients with dcis .\nthe role of radiotherapy after breast - conserving surgery is supported by large randomized studies for improvement of local control ; however , none of these studies showed an improvement in survival or decrease in the risk of distant metastases [ 1 , 1214 ] .\na recent overview of the randomized trials of radiotherapy in dcis showed that radiotherapy reduced the absolute 10-year risk of ipsilateral recurrent dcis by 8.4% and of ipsilateral invasive cancer by 8.5% ( both p < 0.00001 ) .\nhowever , after 10 years of follow - up there was no significant effect on breast cancer mortality , mortality from causes other than breast cancer , or overall mortality .\nin the present study administration of adjuvant radiotherapy after breast - conserving surgery increased through the years for all ages , however , remained lower for the elderly aged 75 years and older .\nthe identification of low risk groups within the elderly patients in whom radiotherapy can be omitted as well as the development of newer radiation techniques should be a priority . in the present study , data concerning the cause of deaths was not available .\nhowever , we were able to estimate the excess mortality by comparing the mortality in the cohort to mortality in the general population ( matched for sex , year , and age ) .\nthe present study showed no excess mortality as compared to the general population in patients who underwent surgery .\npatients who were not surgically treated were excluded from this analysis as they are probably considered to frail and by such are not comparable to the general population .\nas far as we know , there is only one published population - based report of the likelihood of breast cancer death among women with dcis ( n = 7072 ) .\nbreast cancer deaths were assessed in two groups based on the introduction of screening mammography ( 19781983 and 19841989 ) . among women diagnosed in the early period , 1.5% died of breast cancer within 5 years and 3.4% in 10 years ; among the women diagnosed in the latter period 0.7% died of breast cancer within 5 years and 1.9% in 10 years .\nthe study of ernster et al . reported a 10-year standardized mortality ratio of 1.9 ( 95% ci 1.22.3 ) .\ndirect comparison of the numbers is however not possible as the study of ernster calculated the standardized mortality ratio and the present study the estimated excess ( relative ) mortality .\nthe latest numbers in the study of ernster et al . were from 19841989 while the present study describes 19972005 .\ndiagnostic precision ( by introduction of the digital mammography ) has probably improved in that period so that patients are less likely to have unrecognized microinvasive breast cancer or the proportion of detected dcis with low malignant potential has increased .\nthis could also possibly reduce the excess mortality due to breast cancer in our cohort as compared to ernster et al .  \nas almost all women were treated surgically , it is impossible to know from these data the extent to which the low excess mortality from breast cancer among women with dcis results from effective treatment or reflects the relative benign nature of the disease or probably both\n. remarkably , we did find an excess mortality in the younger patients ( < 50 years ) treated with mastectomy .\nit could be that a large proportion of this group are brca1\/2 carriers ; however we have no information to verify this .\nmortality was stratified for age ( to assess differences in young and elderly patients ) and treatment .\nthe aim of the stratification in treatments was not to compare treatments between strata as this would not be possible due to confounding by indication .\ninstead , we aimed to assess excess mortality over strata for each surgical treatment group . in the present study we had no data concerning recurrences in individual patients .\nhowever , despite the fact that some of these women would have experienced a recurrence , excess mortality due to that recurrence is presumably low .\napproximately half of the recurrences are not invasive and can be cured with additional surgery .\nfurthermore , patients who present with invasive cancer have also a low risk of distant disease .   for\nsome ages excess mortality was below 1.0 ( observed mortality did not exceed expected mortality ) indicating that women with dcis represent a generally healthy subgroup of the population which was also confirmed in the study of ernster et al . .\nwomen who present for mammography may have healthier lifestyles than other women ; studies have shown that women who undergo regular screening are more socioeconomically advantaged and practice more preventive health behaviors than women who do not [ 3 , 16 , 17 ] .\nmoreover , breast cancer is more often diagnosed in women with a higher socioeconomic background .   in conclusion ,\nthe present population - based study of almost 8500 patients in the netherlands shows no excess mortality in surgically treated women over 50 years with dcis ;

About 70% of the cases of CINS show benign histology in their excision specimen (Coombs et al. 1988), which can be observed at high magnification with the aid of an optical microscope and an objective lens of 10\u201320\u00d7 (Coombs and Bartsch 2002). At low magnification using a high-resolution stereo microscope, histomorphological features of the lesion are less prominent, making it difficult to distinguish between neoplastic and inflammatory changes (Coombs and Bartsch 2002, Nuyten et al. 2010). Thus, for the definitive diagnosis of CINS, surgical histopathology is the only reliable method. However, in the majority of cases, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis is also performed to support the histopathological diagnosis.\n\nCINS can be classified into different types according to the morphology of the cells, that is, monomorphous and polymorphous, on the basis of the IHC profile and the expression pattern of the ER, PGR, HER2, and CK (Merk et al. 2015). The first one is characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of histologically identical epithelial cells, whereas the second is manifested by the presence of cells with different histological properties in the same tumour (Merk et al. 2015). CINS can also be classified into 2 subtypes: benign, which corresponds to low and intermediate malignancy potential, and malignant, which corresponds to high malignancy potential and higher invasiveness (Coombs and Bartsch 2002). In the literature, most CINS are benign (Merk et al. 2015), with malignant transformation being exceptional, with an incidence of 0.5\u20132% (Miyake et al. 2005, Coombs and Bartsch 2002, Aoyagi et al. 2011).\n\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the IHC profiles of 11 IHC biomarkers (i.e., PGR, CK5\/6, P53, E-Cadherin, KRT14, ER, PGR, HER2, and c-MYC), on both low- and high-magnification views of CIN samples.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n"}
{"article":"systemic chemotherapy in cancer patients with liver tumors or liver metastases shows up to now especially with respect to the prolongation of overall survival insufficient results probably due to not high enough local tumor drug dosages .\ncollins and coworkers could show that the response rates can be doubled when the drug concentration is increased by a factor of 10 . however , systemic applied cytostatic drugs may worsen the quality of life of patients by sometimes very severe adverse side effects especially when used in high dosages . those cytotoxic side effects limit the use of efficient dosages . thus , since several years various techniques were investigated and used for intra - arterial administration of certain cytostatic drugs , which allows higher drug concentrations .\nit could be shown , for example , that regional infusion of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) increases liver exposure to the drug by a factor of 100 when compared to intravenous application route .\nin fact , meanwhile , several randomized clinical trials in colon cancer patients suffering from liver metastases have shown that the intra - arterial application of 5-fu or floxuridine leads to increased response rates with a tendency to prolongation of the overall survival [ 510 ] . however , the liver is a high blood flow organ receiving a large fraction of the cardiac output leading immediately to transportation of the drug outside the target organ . in this context ,\nreduction of the regional blood flow by occluding the vascular bed when administering the drug is one of the most important factors for an effective drug delivery into the liver tumor via intra - arterial application .\nseveral embolization materials were tested and used to reduce the regional blood flow [ 3 , 11 , 12 ] . however , some of these materials lead to permanent vascular occlusion and thus limit repeated treatments [ 3 , 11 , 12 ]\n. meanwhile , the implantation of degradable starch microspheres ( dsm ) to tace is accepted by several publications showing the near - term reproducibility , higher accumulation rates of the coapplied drugs , less toxicity though significantly reduced cytotoxic peak plasma concentrations , less postembolization syndrome , and the unique possibilities of combination with drugs and other treatment techniques [ 3 , 11 , 1319 ] .\ndsm are produced from partly hydrolysed starch , cross - linked , and substituted with glycerol ether groups and are degradable by -amylase .\nthe complete degradation of dsm by -amylase causes only a short - lasting temporary vascular occlusion , which allows a repeated application of dsm in tace .\nvarious cytostatic drugs have been used in combination with dsm , for example , mitomycin c , doxorubicin , epirubicin , or cisplatin , showing a significant better tumor response [ 12 , 13 ] .\nobjective clinical response rates up to 88% have been shown by some published clinical trials [ 21 , 22 ] .\nmore recently vogl and coworkers published data from 462 patients with liver metastases from colon cancer , which were treated with dsm combined with a cytostatic drug showing an improved median overall survival ( 38 months ) after primary diagnosis compared to reported data using intravenous applied chemotherapy .   although several clinical and experimental data are published about the effect of dsm in cancer treatment , it is still not fully clarified what happens within the blood vessel during the degradation processes .\nthe aim of the present study was to visualize and measure the accumulation of 5-fu combined with dsm into healthy liver as well as into liver tumor tissue of experimental induced liver cancer in rats using intravital microscopy and biochemical measurement , respectively .\nfurthermore , the processes of degradation of dsm are visually monitored in order to get more insight into the mechanism of the degradation to fully understand the resulting increased drug uptake into the liver tumor lesion .\nto investigate the processes of dsm degradation , dsm based occlusion of blood vessels , and dsm based drug accumulation into healthy liver as well as into experimental liver tumors of rats , the technique of intravital microscopy was used . for optimal visualization , dsm and\nthe experimental animals were wag \/ rij - rats ( wistar albino glaxo ) , weighting between 250 and 300  g , at our disposal .\nanimals were used in accordance with the national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals .  \nexperimental rat liver tumors were prepared by using the tumor cell line cc531 , which is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma originating from the colon of rats exposed to methylazoxymethanol .\ndrug targeting ,  max - delbrck - centre for molecular - diagnostic medicine , berlin - buch .\nthe tumor cells were implanted into the rat liver , which is an established model for human liver metastasis of colorectal carcinoma .\nanaesthesia was performed by intramuscular injection of xylazine ( 12  mg \/ kg ) and ketamine - hcl ( 80  mg \/ kg ) . additional anaesthesia was given intravenously , whenever necessary .\nsubsequently , the rats were dissected by a midline abdominal incision through the linea alba . after having retracted the left liver lobe , the tumor cell suspension ( 7.5  10 cells per rat )\nwas injected through a cannula ( 0.45  15  mm ) , strictly subcapsular .\nthe penetration mark was sealed with tissue glue ( histoacryl , b. braun surgical gmbh , melsungen , germany ) .\ninfection prophylaxiswas performed by intraperitoneal administration of 0.03  ml penicillin - g ( penicillin  grnenthal  , 1 mega ; grnenthal gmbh , stolberg , germany ) and streptomycin ( streptomycin - heyl 1  g ; heyl chem .- pharm .\ndsm ( spherex , pharmacia , erlangen , germany ) alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fu were injected into the blood vessel which supplies the rat liver .\nto evaluate the normal blood flow , erythrocytes were marked by a fluorescent dye by injection of 12  mg in 0.2  ml of 1  g \/ l fluorescent sodium 0.1  ml into the cannulised gastroduodenal artery ( gda ) , the proper hepatic artery .\ndsm as well as 5-fu were also fitc - labelled and were likewise injected .  \nthe gastroduodenal artery ( gda ) as well as the smaller peripheral vessels was exposed to the liver surface by retraction of the left liver lobe . during the procedure ,\nthe surface of the liver lobe was covered with a small piece of plastic wrap and constantly rinsed with ringer solution at body temperature .\nthe retracted left liver lobe was carefully placed under a fluorescent microscope and transilluminated with monochromatic light , generated by a prism monochromator equipped with xenon light .\nthe accumulation rates of 5-fu within the liver and liver tumor applied with or without amilomer , dsm , were biochemically measured by hplc . before measurement ,\ntherefore , 5 animals each were killed 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 240 minutes after i.a therapy with 5-fu and without dsm being started , and the 5-fu concentrations in different organs were determined by hplc . an additional time point ( 480  min ) was selected in the therapy group 5-fu with dsm .\n\n figure 1 shows the normal microcirculation of the liver blood flow by visualization of the fitc - labelled erythrocytes .\ninjection of fitc - labelled dsm leads to occlusion of the microcirculation ( figure 2 ) .\nfurthermore , it can be found in peripheral tumor areas leading to occlusion of the microcirculation around the tumor margin .\ninfusion of 5-fu by intra - arterial application combined with dms shows an increased drug accumulation within the tumor tissue compared to the normal liver parenchyma .\nthis can be also demonstrated by biochemical measurement showing that the auc in the targeted tumor tissue is 95 times higher when 5-fu is applied in combination with dms . as shown in figure 3\n, dsm accumulates within the arterioles and blood vessels immediately after dms is injected into the hepatic artery leading to stepwise occlusion of the vessel . after approximately 8 minutes ,\nfirst sign of dsm degradation process can be observed after approximately 713 minutes ( figure 4(a ) ) .\nthe contours of the particles become more diffuse and the fitc - labelled degraded material is eliminated by washout ( figure 4(b ) ) . shortly afterwards , the remaining still intact but smaller particles are washed out along with the physiological blood flow in direction of the capillary bed and the systemic blood circulation ( figure 4(c ) ) .\nafter round about 2540 minutes , all starch microspheres are dissolved and no dsm particles are visible .\ninterestingly , the degradation processes of dsm lead to temporally blood flow shiftings caused by a negative pressure in the occluded blood vessels ( figure 5 ) .\nthe blood flow movements are supposed to be mainly caused by the degradation mode of -amylase leading to randomly and stepwise degradation of the microspheres .\nfurthermore , the particles are designed to maintain their spherical shape until they are completely dissolved .\nthese stepwise processes leave the degraded material during the degradation process within the blood vessels . due to the increasing arterial pressure and due to the persisting occlusion effect of dsm\nthereby , a negative pressure is created and may lead to the temporally reciprocal blood flow via some of the side - arms of the major blood vessels . these forward and backward movements happened several times even in peripheral tumor areas leading to increased contact frequency of the drug with the tumor tissue .\nafter application of fitc - labelled 5-fu without combination of dsm , the chemotherapeutic agents diffuse immediately and accumulate within a few minutes into the healthy liver parenchyma ( figure 6(a ) ) .\nthe blood vessels appear dark . by using the same dosage of the cytostatic drug , fitc - labelled 5-fu accumulates in a slightly higher concentration into liver tumor parenchyma ( figure 6(b ) ) .\nbut in contrast to normal parenchyma , the normal liver reticulation can not be visualized due to the equable diffusion of the drug ( figure 6(b ) ) . after approximately 25  min ,\nthe 5-fu concentration is still constant visible in the healthy liver parenchyma with or without dsm ( figure 7 ) .\nthe pharmacologically proven small differences between the concentration rates of an applied drug combined with or without dsm   are not clearly visible due to the very small differences in the concentration rates . however , in liver tumor tissue , the differences in the 5-fu accumulation rates in relation to combination of dsm are , even after 25 minutes , clearly visible ( figure 8) .\nthe 5-fu accumulates in higher intensity with coapplication of dsm ( figure 8(b ) ) than without chemo - occlusion ( figure 8(a ) ) .   in healthy liver parenchyma as well as in liver tumor tissue ,\nthe accumulation rates of 5-fu are increased when dsm is combined ( figure 9 ) .\nthe peak level after intra - arterial infusion of 5-fu alone was in the healthy liver parenchyma 58.65  g \/ g and in the tumor tissue 25.09  g \/ g .\nthe concentration maximum was reached after approximately 15 minutes ( figure 9(a ) ) . when combined with dsm ,\nthe peak level of 5-fu was 433.39  g \/ g in the healthy liver parenchyma and 664.39  g \/ g in the tumor tissue .\nthe concentration maximum of 5-fu was reached approximately 30 minutes after intra - arterial infusion with dsm ( figure 9(b ) ) .\n5-fu in liver tissue was still measurable 12 hours after administration when combined with dsm compared to only 90 minutes when applied without dsm ( figure 9 ) .  \nthe therapy group 5-fu with dsm demonstrated significantly higher 5-fu concentrations ( p < 0.01 ) compared to the intra - arterial group 5-fu alone . in group 5-fu alone i.a .\nthe 5-fu auc in the healthy liver parenchyma and tumor tissue measured at the time points from 15 to 240  min was 1704  g \/ g and 655  g \/ g , respectively .\nthe highest concentrations were measured after the administration of 5-fu combined with dsm ( auc 15480  min ) 62655  g \/ g in tumor tissue compared to ( auc 15480  min ) 27822  g \/ g in the healthy liver tissue .\nthe intra - arterial infusion of 5-fu along with dsm led to a 95 times higher auc in the targeted tumor tissue .\nthe even observed increased auc in the healthy liver was clearly less intense ( figure 10 ) .\nintra - arterial administrations of a cytostatic drug are used to expose the tumor to higher drug concentration without having an increased toxicity to the patients .\nseveral publications have shown in clinical [ 12 , 13 , 16 , 2123 , 2628 ] as well as in pharmacological studies [ 2 , 5 , 11 , 17 ] or see above our own unpublished data that dsm within tace is an effective treatment especially in palliative settings of patients with primary liver cancer or hepatic metastases .\nthe use of dsm in tace has been shown to improve the time to progress as well as the overall survival of treated patients with primary liver cancer in a phase iii clinical trial published by taguchi and coworkers in 1992 .\nsimilar results were published by vogl and coworkers in 2009   and pohlen and coworkers in 2006   for patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer .  \nthe use of dsm to tace is meanwhile accepted to lead to higher accumulation rates of the coapplied drugs and less toxicity through significantly reduced cytotoxic peak plasma concentrations .\nfor example , andersson et al .   could show that combining dsm with mitomycin c reduces the systemic exposure of the chemotherapeutic drug leading to less hematologic toxicity .\nfurthermore they showed that the area under the concentration time curve ( auc ) in treated patients was significantly lower when the drug was coadministrated with dsm , while the terminal half - life ( t1\/2 ) of mitomycin c was unchanged .\nbeside mitomycin several other chemotherapeutic drugs like 5-fu , gemcitabine , or doxorubicin   can be used along with dsm within tace in order to significantly enhance the accumulation of the drug into the target tissue . moreover ,\npohlen and coworkers [ 24 , 29 ] could show that a liposomal carrier ( stealth liposome ) used for drug targeting approaches achieved better results in combination with dsm leading to a 2203 times increase of the intratumoral concentration of 5-fu [ 24 , 29 ] .\nthese previous results are concordant with the results of the present investigation showing the effective and enhanced accumulation of 5-fu within liver tumor tissue when combined with dsm .\nnowadays , a lot of facts are known about the unique way of decelerating the blood flow in dsm filled vessels .\nnevertheless , it is yet not fully understood and clarified why especially dsm had beneficial impacts on tumor treatment along with chemoembolization procedures .\nthe present study verified that one of the main reasons for this purpose is the common known embolization material effect \nthe closing of the main tumor supporting vessels leading to reduction of the regional blood flow .\nhowever , several other tested embolization materials can also reduce the regional blood flow [ 3 , 11 , 12 ] .\nthe advantage of dms compared to other occluding embolization materials may be probably due to its dynamic effects caused by the mechanism of the degradation processes . here , we could show that the stepwise degradation processes of dsm via -amylase lead to temporally blood - flow - shiftings caused by a negative pressure in the occluded blood vessels .\nthe remaining degraded dsm material as well as the persisting occlusion effect of dsm leads to increasing arterial pressure . as a result\n, the blood flow centralizes in the side - arms of the precapillary system . as a result\na negative pressure is created , which leads to a temporally reciprocal blood flow via some of the side - arms of the major blood vessels .\nthese forward and backward movements happened several times leading to increased contact frequency of the drug within the tumor tissue and thus can explain the advantageous effects of using dsm in tace .\nthe variability of the arterial blood flow caused by dynamic changes in the dsm degradation processes could also be demonstrated by civalleri and coworkers .\nthey could show that the use of dsm causes flow redistribution towards the hypovascular areas . when using the drug alone , only very low drug concentrations reach the hypovascular regions in spite of a comparably high initial dose leading to the suggestion that cancer cells within this area may probably lead to disease progression .   beside the above described effects\n, it is well known that the use of dsm causes much less postembolization syndrome than using other common embolization material [ 32 , 33 ] . by analysing the microscopic pictures of the present study\n, one can suppose that this effect can also be explained by dsm caused visible dynamic changes within the blood vessels leading probably to a shorter ischemia time laps for the healthy or tumor unaffected tissue\n.   the use of dms in tace may also give the advantage to combine immune therapeutic treatment approaches .\naltomonte and coworkers   could , for example , demonstrate that injection of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine along with dsm ( embocept ) into the hepatic artery of rats with experimental induced hcc leads to a higher accumulation of the virus into the target organ as well as to a higher level of tumor necrosis and improvement of the survival .\nfurthermore , a combination of dsm with an adenovirus administered through the hepatic area has been shown to result in an efficient and cancer selective gene transfer .   during the last decade , immune therapeutic treatment approaches focused mainly on the use of autologous dendritic cells in vaccination strategies in order to induce an antitumor response by activation and induction of tumor - specific cytostatic t cells . however ,\na lot of patients have a functionally impaired immune system due to the previous applied cytostatic drugs .\nseveral systemic applied cytostatic drugs may lead to immune suppression and reduction of certain immune cells limiting the effect of immune therapeutic treatment strategies .\non the other hand , it has been shown that chemotherapeutics can exhibit several beneficial effects on the immune system in spite of its myelosuppressive effects .\nfor example , gemcitabine increases the antigen cross - presentation , t lymphocyte expansion , and the t - cell infiltration of tumors   and 5-fu has been described to upregulate tumor antigen expression on colorectal cancer cells . in fact , some pilot clinical trials in cancer patients indicate that the efficacy of anticancer vaccines may be enhanced by chemotherapy .   beside our results and\npublished data from other groups showing the advantage of dsm in tace , a high - class randomized clinical study with respect to a prolongation of the overall survival is still lacking . those randomized prospective clinical trials choosing the overall survival as primary endpoint will give the chance to discover whether there is a statistically significant survival benefit as well as an improvement of the quality of life for cancer patients receiving regional drug therapy with dsm .\nmoreover , the stimulatory effect of chemotherapy on tumor immunogenicity without impairing the immune effector cell function may provide a strong rationale to combine tace using dsm with dendritic cell vaccination procedures .\ntaken together , the investigations show that dsm is a very effective embolization material leading to effective and enhanced accumulation of 5-fu especially within the liver tumor tissue .\nthe selective increased accumulation of the drug in the tumor tissue is supposed to be partly due to portal washout , which occurs only in healthy liver parenchyma .\ninterestingly , the degradation processes of dsm lead to temporally blood flow shiftings caused by a negative pressure in the occluded blood vessels .\nthis mechanism may also lead to increased contact frequency of the drug with the tumor tissue . by using dms in transarterial chemoembolization ( tace ) , severe adverse side effects like post - embolization syndrome\nare rarely observed when compared to other embolization materials like lipiodol or permanent embolization materials .\nseveral of these materials lead to a permanent vascular occlusion and thus limit repeated treatments .\nthe complete degradation of dsm causes only a short - lasting temporary vascular occlusion , which allows a repeat application of dsm in tace .\nmeanwhile , it is known that some chemotherapeutics can exhibit several beneficial effects on the immune system in spite of its myelosuppressive effects .\nfor example , 5-fu has been described to upregulate tumor antigen expression on cancer cells .\nthus , the use of dsm in tace can be probably combined with immune therapeutic treatment approaches not having the same myelosuppressive effect as when the drug is administered systemically .","abstract":" treatment efficacy in cancer patients using systemically applied cytostatic drugs is decreased by cytotoxic side effects , which limits the use of efficient dosages . \n degradable starch microspheres ( dsm ) are used to apply drugs into blood vessels which supply the target organ leading to drug accumulation in the target organ by reduction of the blood flow . \n the present investigations show that dsm is a very effective embolization material leading to effective and enhanced accumulation of 5-fu within the liver tumor tissue of experimental induced liver cancer in rats . by using intravital microscopy , \n a rapid deceleration of the blood flow into the target organ is observed immediately after application of dsm . \n the microspheres are stepwise degraded in the direction of the systemic blood flow and are totally dissolved after 25 minutes . \n these stepwise processes leave the degraded material during the degradation process within the vessels leading to temporally reciprocal blood flow via some of the side -

Conclusion","-fs-cml-models-Falcon-falcon-7b_generated_text_wo_prompt":" a liver-targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents could increase the local antitumor effect and, moreover, it does not need to be performed only in patients with advanced liver disease. In their prospective, randomized, blinded controlled phase II-trial (study no 2008\/001), 60 patients with a median age of 51.2 years (range 23.0 to 66.8 years), histologically diagnosed, chemo-na\u00efve, primary liver cancer, had received systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine and paclitaxel (DTP chemotherapy) before the liver-directed therapy for liver tumors or metastases. The first group of 30 patients received systemic chemotherapy alone (group 1). The second group (group 2) were treated with 7 weekly intra-arterial chemotherapy cycles with Doxil in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine followed by 4 chemotherapy cycles without Doxil. The aim of treatment with Doxil was to locally target the chemotherapeutic agents into the liver. The median number of cycles (2-6) of liver-directed intra-arterial chemotherapy was 3 (range 1 to 4). All patients received the scheduled chemotherapy, no protocol violations occurred. No severe adverse events could be observed. A liver-directed chemotherapy regimen with Doxil-based intra-arterial chemotherapy significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) in liver cancer compared to standard systemic chemotherapy alone, with 20% vs. 4.7%. According to the authors the results indicate that liver-directed chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients with advanced liver cancer and that CR might be achievable with liver-directed combination chemotherapy.\nReferences:\n1.

the proximal small bowel is on the right , and the cecum is on the left . in type ii malrotation , the derangement in rotation occurs between 6 and 10 weeks and disrupts duodenal rotation .\nan error after 10 weeks results in type iii malrotation , in which the duodenum only completes 90 of additional rotation .\nfibrous bands called ladd 's bands crossing over the second portion of the duodenum connect the cecum to the right upper quadrant.5 when intestinal malrotation is symptomatic , elective operative intervention is indicated .\nthe ladd 's procedure is the standard of care for resolving symptoms and preventing future complications .\nthe ladd 's procedure includes untwisting the volvulus counterclockwise , division of the abnormal coloduodenal ladd 's bands , widening of the mesenteric base to prevent further volvulus , and appendectomy.6 an appendectomy is performed because of the atypical localization of pain and tenderness of acute appendicitis in the setting of intestinal malrotation .\nhowever , the management of asymptomatic intestinal malrotation patients diagnosed incidentally remains unclear.4,7,8 in the present case , intestinal malrotation was diagnosed incidentally by preoperative abdomino - pelvic computed tomography . before the diagnosis , the patient had no history of abdominal complaints .\nlaparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer was accepted because of short - term advantages , such as reduced pain , shorter hospital stays , and early recovery , over conventional open surgery.9 - 11 the laparoscopic ladd 's procedure for the treatment of patients who have intestinal malrotation without midgut volvulus is also safe and effective.12,13 thus , we scheduled the patient for laparoscopic surgery .\na few alterations were made in the standard approach to the total gastrectomy with roux - en - y esophagojejunostomy because of intestinal malrotation .\nthere were no ladd 's bands , and the small bowel was already found on the right side and the colon on the left side .\nwe modified the minilaparotomy site and roux limb rotation . to avoid mesenteric twisting , we performed esophagojejunostomy with the roux limb in a clockwise rotation instead of the routine counterclockwise rotation . in laparoscopic surgery , the adequate angle to stapler access is core to perform successful intracorporeal bowel anastomosis .\nthus , many laparoscopic procedures have standard trocar and stapler insertion angle . however , when performing gastrectomy to malrotated patient , the standard minilaparotomy for esophagojejunostomy may lead to mesenteric twisting or tension to anastomosis site . to perform adequate anastomosis to the patient of presented case , we made minilaparotomy site to opposite to the usual insertion site to overcome such difficulties . to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients with intestinal malrotation . in conclusion , in the setting of the incidental finding of asymptomatic intestinal malrotation during gastric cancer surgery , a laparoscopic approach can be conducted successfully when it is performed with a proper roux limb orientation through an alternative minilaparotomy .","abstract":" as the incidence of early gastric cancer increases , laparoscopic surgery has become one of the treatments of choice for gastric cancer . with the increase of laparoscopic surgery , the chance of discovering aberrant anatomy during the operation also increases . \n we present a case of laparoscopic total gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with intestinal malrotation . \n intestinal malrotation occurs in one in every 500 births . \n we found that laparoscopic total gastrectomy in such patients can be performed successfully when it is performed with a proper roux limb orientation through an alternative minilaparotomy .

aortic sinus .\nthese procedures can result in a complex suture line , which not only changes the geometry of the neo - aortic sinus , but also causes distortion with somatic growth and a decrease in neo - aortic distensibility .\nmoreover , because the pulmonary valve is not designed to perform as the normal aortic valve , the excessive burden placed on the pulmonary valve in the systemic position can affect neoaortic valvar function , possibly leading to valvar incompetence over time . as in other studies\nthe development of ai is known to be related to more advanced age at the time of aso , previous pulmonary artery banding , use of trap - door coronary reimplantation rather than the punch technique , size discrepancies between the aorta and the pulmonary artery , ai at discharge , and rapid development of aortic root dilatation.3 - 5 ) we evaluated the relationship between ai progression and risk factors , such as prior pab , presence of vsd , older age at the time of aso ( 1 month or more after birth ) , and aorta - pulmonary artery size discrepancy .\nin contrast to previous findings , however , we identified no risk factors for ai progression in the present study , which may be due to the small number of patients with significant ai .\nps was the most common cause of reoperation or intervention after aso , as in previous studies.6 - 11 ) the mechanism of ps is not well known , but the long course of the pulmonary artery can be stretched with somatic growth due to frequent use of the lecompte maneuver in tga with the vessels located in an anterior - posterior relationship , and that may be one of the causes of ps .\nstenosis at any level of the pulmonary artery is possible , but in our observations , it occurred mainly in the supravalvar area , in the branches or the main pulmonary artery .\nprevious studies have reported that significant ps was found in 10 - 30% patients.8)10)11 ) in recent work described by jatene et al.,9 ) severe supravalvar ps ( a mean gradient of > 60 mmhg ) was reported in 7.4% of his cases , and all patients underwent reoperation .\nin contrast , as is rarely observed in long - term follow - up after aso , which may be due to the lack of traction between the neo - aorta and the pulmonary trunk . likewise , pi was seldom observed , which may be due to the lower shear force and tensile stress in the pulmonary circulatory system .\none of the most common and serious morbidities in long - term follow - up after aso involves coronary artery complications such as coronary artery obstruction or stenosis .\nearlier reports showed a prevalence varying from 2% to 11%.11 - 15 ) a recent retrospective study encompassing 1,198 patients by legendre et al.16 ) showed frequent coronary artery complications , with a prevalence of 6.8% . in this study\n. the relatively lower prevalence of coronary complications in our study compared with previous studies is likely because we included only simple complete tga and assessed the prevalence of coronary complications except for 2 cases of early mortality due to coronary insufficiency .\npossible mechanisms for coronary artery obstruction include stretching of the coronary artery with somatic growth , fibrocellular intimal thickening , extrinsic compression , and anatomical kinking or torsion.17 ) a recent meta - analysis of 9 independent series,18 ) including a total of 1,942 patients , revealed that single coronary patterns and intramural coronary arteries were associated with significant mortality .\nhowever , neither intramural nor single coronary patterns were found in any patients with coronary obstructions that required revascularization , which may be due to the small number of patients included in this study .\ncoronary artery obstruction was an important cause of both early and late death in previous studies.3)12)19 - 21 ) however , accurate diagnosis of coronary lesions is challenging .\ntypical clinical signs of coronary dysfunction , such as chest pain or syncope , were not observed in most patients , as seen in other studies.17)19)20 ) indeed , earlier studies revealed that severe coronary lesions , including stenosis , compression , and occlusion , occurred in 3 - 7.8% of symptom - free patients.17)22 ) with advancements in resolution and new techniques , echocardiography has become a valuable tool in detecting stenosis of the proximal and distal coronary arteries , as well as functional assessment through measurement of the coronary flow reserve .\nhowever , epicardial coronary artery evaluation is limited , and because of the poor window for anatomic assessments of coronary arteries in many cases , echocardiography plays only an additive role for coronary angiography.23 ) myocardial spect is a widely used noninvasive method , although it is less sensitive than conventional angiography in detecting significant coronary lesions , because retrograde perfusion from collateral circulation may protect the myocardium.16 ) the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography and myocardial spect for predicting coronary artery lesions were analyzed in this study , and we found that the sensitivity of myocardial spect was higher than that of echocardiography , reaching 75% ( table 3 ) . of 8 patients with perfusion defects shown by myocardial spect , 4 underwent coronary angiography .\nthree patients showed complete ostial occlusion of the left coronary artery , with a normal or false - positive result in 1 patient .\nbengel et al.24 ) reported that coronary flow reserve measured by stress echocardiography or positron emission tomography was diminished in the absence of ischemic symptoms in children late after aso.25 ) one possible reason for the discrepancies between the results of myocardial spect and coronary angiography in our data may be the decrease in coronary flow reserve .\nbecause msct began in earnest at our institute in 2002 , data were limited in this study .\nmsct has the advantage of providing a better understanding of mechanisms behind coronary artery obstruction than conventional angiography , because it gives three - dimensional information about the abnormal course of the coronary artery between the great arteries .\na recent study on msct showed that the technique accurately detected ostial and proximal segments of transferred coronary artery stenosis when compared to conventional angiography.26 ) however , msct has some limitations for the reliable assessment of coronary arteries .\nimage quality can be poor , especially when tachycardia or severe coronary calcification is present.27 ) administration of additional beta - blockers prior to msct may improve image quality , but it is impossible to apply to all patients , especially those who have had decreased systolic function .\nnonetheless , a recently developed 64-slice ct considerably overcame these limitations , but not completely .\nanother innovative method , intracoronary ultrasound , provides cross - sectional , transmural tomographic images of the coronary arteries and reflects vessel wall histology.28 ) this technique has been shown to be superior to conventional angiography in evaluating intimal wall thickening .\ncoronary angiography and intracoronary ultrasound are together the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting various forms of coronary lesions , although they are invasive .\nthough universal long - term follow - up guidelines are not available for aso patients , coronary evaluation should be performed at regular intervals , utilizing both noninvasive and invasive methods , because only systematic evaluation can detect coronary lesions in their early stages and prevent sudden cardiac death due to coronary obstruction .\nrecent evidence suggests that obesity is quite prevalent in patients with tga.29 ) in this study group , 6 patients ( 7.5% ) had an observed body mass index ( bmi ) of more than 25 and were classified as obese , and the prevalence of obesity was similar to that of the general pediatric population .\nespecially careful attention must be paid to these obese patients with vulnerable coronary arteries because of the potential for early atherosclerosis and abnormal coronary vascular reserve .\nthe distribution of the nyha class in the late follow - up period did not differ from that in another study , and most patients ( 98% ) showed nyha class 1 activity.11 ) symptoms or wall motion abnormalities that suggest myocardial ischemia were inconsistent with nyha functional class .\nof 17 patients with an ejection fraction of less than 55% based on echocardiography , 16 ( 94.1% ) belonged to nyha class 1 and only 1 patient ( 5.9% ) belonged to class 3 .\ntherefore , we might conclude that nyha classification is not sufficiently sensitive to identify patients with significant systolic dysfunction .\nthe high - risk coronary artery patterns that cause postoperative hypoxia due to immediate coronary obstruction are as follows : high take - off , para - commissural origin , tangential origin , intramural , and single coronary artery.18)30 ) careful attention during surgery is required when treating such high - risk patients , especially when the coronary artery is transferred to minimize hypoxic damage and improve functional and neuro - developmental outcomes .\nwe acknowledge the following limitations of the present study : first , coronary artery evaluations , such as angiography , myocardial spect , and msct , were not performed in all patients , so we could not completely identify all the coronary artery complications .\nsecond , we determined the re - operation - free rate and survival rate using only data from patients currently involved in follow - up\n. therefore , the actual re - operation - free rate and survival rate may be less than the present study reports .\nour results require further validation with more children undergoing aso through a multi - institutional prospective study .\n44% of enrolled patients showed some degree of ai , and 14% of patients had more than moderate ai .\noperative procedures include transection of both great arteries above the sinotubular junction and transfer of the coronary arteries into the neo -

term follow - up after aso involves coronary artery complications such as coronary artery obstruction or stenosis .\nearlier reports showed a prevalence varying from 2% to 11%.11 - 15 ) a recent retrospective study encompassing 1,198 patients by legendre et al.16 ) showed frequent coronary artery complications , with a prevalence of 6.8% . in this study\n. the relatively lower prevalence of coronary complications in our study compared with previous studies is likely because we included only simple complete tga and assessed the prevalence of coronary complications except for 2 cases of early mortality due to coronary insufficiency .\npossible mechanisms for coronary artery obstruction include stretching of the coronary artery with somatic growth , fibrocellular intimal thickening , extrinsic compression , and anatomical kinking or torsion.17 ) a recent meta - analysis of 9 independent series,18 ) including a total of 1,942 patients , revealed that single coronary patterns and intramural coronary arteries were associated with significant mortality .\nhowever , neither intramural nor single coronary patterns were found in any patients with coronary obstructions that required revascularization , which may be due to the small number of patients included in this study .\ncoronary artery obstruction was an important cause of both early and late death in previous studies.3)12)19 - 21 ) however , accurate diagnosis of coronary lesions is challenging .\ntypical clinical signs of coronary dysfunction , such as chest pain or syncope , were not observed in most patients , as seen in other studies.17)19)20 ) indeed , earlier studies revealed that severe coronary lesions , including stenosis , compression , and occlusion , occurred in 3 - 7.8% of symptom - free patients.17)22 ) with advancements in resolution and new techniques , echocardiography has become a valuable tool in detecting stenosis of the proximal and distal coronary arteries , as well as functional assessment through measurement of the coronary flow reserve .\nhowever , epicardial coronary artery evaluation is limited , and because of the poor window for anatomic assessments of coronary arteries in many cases , echocardiography plays only an additive role for coronary angiography.23 ) myocardial spect is a widely used noninvasive method , although it is less sensitive than conventional angiography in detecting significant coronary lesions , because retrograde perfusion from collateral circulation may protect the myocardium.16 ) the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography and myocardial spect for predicting coronary artery lesions were analyzed in this study , and we found that the sensitivity of myocardial spect was higher than that of echocardiography , reaching 75% ( table 3 ) . of 8 patients with perfusion defects shown by myocardial spect , 4 underwent coronary angiography .\nthree patients showed complete ostial occlusion of the left coronary artery , with a normal or false - positive result in 1 patient .\nbengel et al.24 ) reported that coronary flow reserve measured by stress echocardiography or positron emission tomography was diminished in the absence of ischemic symptoms in children late after aso.25 ) one possible reason for the discrepancies between the results of myocardial spect and coronary angiography in our data may be the decrease in coronary flow reserve .\nbecause msct began in earnest at our institute in 2002 , data were limited in this study .\nmsct has the advantage of providing a better understanding of mechanisms behind coronary artery obstruction than conventional angiography , because it gives three - dimensional information about the abnormal course of the coronary artery between the great arteries .\na recent study on msct showed that the technique accurately detected ostial and proximal segments of transferred coronary artery stenosis when compared to conventional angiography.26 ) however , msct has some limitations for the reliable assessment of coronary arteries .\nimage quality can be poor , especially when tachycardia or severe coronary calcification is present.27 ) administration of additional beta - blockers prior to msct may improve image quality , but it is impossible to apply to all patients , especially those who have had decreased systolic function .\nnonetheless , a recently developed 64-slice ct considerably overcame these limitations , but not completely .\nanother innovative method , intracoronary ultrasound , provides cross - sectional , transmural tomographic images of the coronary arteries and reflects vessel wall histology.28 ) this technique has been shown to be superior to conventional angiography in evaluating intimal wall thickening .\ncoronary angiography and intracoronary ultrasound are together the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting various forms of coronary lesions , although they are invasive .\nthough universal long - term follow - up guidelines are not available for aso patients , coronary evaluation should be performed at regular intervals , utilizing both noninvasive and invasive methods , because only systematic evaluation can detect coronary lesions in their early stages and prevent sudden cardiac death due to coronary obstruction .\nrecent evidence suggests that obesity is quite prevalent in patients with tga.29 ) in this study group , 6 patients ( 7.5% ) had an observed body mass index ( bmi ) of more than 25 and were classified as obese , and the prevalence of obesity was similar to that of the general pediatric population .\nespecially careful attention must be paid to these obese patients with vulnerable coronary arteries because of the potential for early atherosclerosis and abnormal coronary vascular reserve .\nthe distribution of the nyha class in the late follow - up period did not differ from that in another study , and most patients ( 98% ) showed nyha class 1 activity.11 ) symptoms or wall motion abnormalities that suggest myocardial ischemia were inconsistent with nyha functional class .\nof 17 patients with an ejection fraction of less than 55% based on echocardiography , 16 ( 94.1% ) belonged to nyha class 1 and only 1 patient ( 5.9% ) belonged to class 3 .\ntherefore , we might conclude that nyha classification is not sufficiently sensitive to identify patients with significant systolic dysfunction .\nthe high - risk coronary artery patterns that cause postoperative hypoxia due to immediate coronary obstruction are as follows : high take - off , para - commissural origin , tangential origin , intramural , and single coronary artery.18)30 ) careful attention during surgery is required when treating such high - risk patients , especially when the coronary artery is transferred to minimize hypoxic damage and improve functional and neuro - developmental outcomes .\nwe acknowledge the following limitations of the present study : first , coronary artery evaluations , such as angiography , myocardial spect , and msct , were not performed in all patients , so we could not completely identify all the coronary artery complications .\nsecond , we determined the re - operation - free rate and survival rate using only data from patients currently involved in follow - up\n. therefore , the actual re - operation - free rate and survival rate may be less than the present study reports .\nour results require further validation with more children undergoing aso through a multi - institutional prospective study .\nbased on the favorable long - term outcomes revealed in this study , aso should be considered the treatment of choice for children with complete tga , as previously reported . however , because some late complications , such as coronary artery obstruction and significant ai and ps , have been found after successful aso , meticulous lifelong follow - up is mandatory in this patient group , and further studies will be required to ascertain long - term complications .","abstract":" background and objectivesalthough coronary artery obstruction , aortic insufficiency ( ai ) , and pulmonary stenosis ( ps ) have been reported after arterial switch operation ( aso ) , limited long -

induced diabetic rats in morris water maze .\nevidence is accumulating that people with diabetes mellitus are at risk of developing cognitive impairments [ 30 , 31 ] .\nit has also been demonstrated that acute hyperglycemia in people with type 2 diabetes significantly impaired speed of information processing , working memory , and some aspects of attention .\nthis deficiency in learning and memory has been suggested to be associated with the changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity [ 9 , 32 ] .\nit has also been suggested that oxidative stress contributes to the learning and memory deficits during hyperglycemia . in the current experiment , it was also found that mda levels , as an index of lipid peroxidation , were increased in the hippocampal and cortical tissues of diabetic rats .\nthese results confirmed the previous reports that streptozotocin - induced diabetes was accompanied by an increased generation of reactive species .\nit is also suggested that the antioxidant compounds may have beneficial effects against the complications of diabetes mellitus [ 3436 ] .\nthe results of the present study showed that metformin improved learning and memory ; it also reduced mda concentration and increased total thiol groups in brain tissues of diabetic rats . in this study , we present evidence that metformin exerts an antioxidative effect , in vivo .\nthis finding is in accordance with other studies which have shown that metformin treatment has antioxidant properties in stz - diabetic rats [ 37 , 38 ] .\nsimilar observations have reported that metformin reduces oxidative stress in various animal models [ 39 , 40 ] .\nit has been previously suggested that metformin also has antioxidant activity which is independent of its effect on insulin activity . in the current study ,\nit has been previously shown that metformin was not able to reduce the plasma levels of glucose in animal models with a high level of glucose similar to the present study . in the present study ,\na lower dose of metformin ( 300  mg \/ kg ) was used and it reduced blood glucose concentrations but the effect was not significant . it is reported that metformin reduces blood glucose level at much higher doses of 450500  mg \/ kg in stz - diabetic rats .\nthe results of human studies have also shown that metformin reduces the plasma glucose concentrations by approximately 20 to 30 percent and it has been suggested to be used in combination with other drugs . regarding the results of present study\n, it seems that the effects of metformin on learning and memory which were seen in the present study are probably independent of the effect on blood glucose level .\nrecently , metformin has been reported to improve microvascular function in type 2 diabetic models without improving hyperglycemia .\n( 2005 ) have also reported that metformin increases nitric oxide activity in diabetic rats . nitric oxide\nis rapidly inactivated by o2 \n  and it has been reported that enhanced formation of o2 \n  radical may be involved in the accelerated breakdown of nitric oxide .\nmoreover , it has been shown that rapid destruction of nitric oxide occurs in diabetic rats .\nthe protective effect of metformin against oxidative stress may prevent the breakdown of nitric oxide , which may improve learning and memory tasks . nitric oxide as a gaseous neurotransmitter has been shown to have an important role in learning and memory .\nit has been previously reported that , when administered for 4 weeks , metformin lowered blood glucose level ; however , these plasma glucose levels were still significantly higher than those of control rats .\nit has also been reported that metformin reduces vascular o2 \n  anion in aortic rings and the amounts of protein carbonyl compounds in serum of diabetic high - fat fed rats .\nseveral studies have reported the inhibitory effect of metformin on oxidative stress under various conditions : in vitro in either hyperglycemic or hyperlipidemic environments and in vivo [ 4749 ] .\nrecently , it was reported that metformin may also diminish oxidative stress - related dna damage . also , metformin treatment diminished the amounts of serum oxidized proteins and tissue lipid peroxides in diabetic rats .\nthe reduction of oxidative stress by metformin may partly be due to inhibition of glycation , a process that directly causes free - radical production .\na recent study suggests that the intracellular antioxidant properties of metformin may result in the inhibition of both the advanced glycation end - products ( ages ) receptor and the lectin - like oxidized receptor . in the present study , teucrium polium hydroalcoholic\nextract prevented learning and memory impairments in diabetic rats . in accordance with the present study\n, it has been reported that teucrium polium protects against memory impairments in scopolamine- and diabetes - induced memory impairment models [ 22 , 53 ] .\nthe notable activity of teucrium polium in memory augmentation could be related to its terpenic and flavonoid compounds .\nthe hypoglycemic effects of teucrium polium have been previously reported [ 12 , 14 ] . in the present study\ntherefore , it seems that the beneficial effect of the extract on learning and memory impairments , which was seen in the present study , is not related to the blood glucose - lowering effect .\nin contrast to some reports which have suggested the blood glucose - lowering effects of teucrium polium , there are also some reports which fail to confirm these effects [ 12 , 56 ] .\nreported that a decoction extract of the plant lowered the blood glucose by 20% similar to what was seen in the present study . in another study , a percolated extract of\nthe plant was not able to reduce the blood sugar in type ii diabetic patients .\nin the present study it was indicated that all three doses of teucrium polium extract significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex .\nthese marked protective effects of teucrium polium against oxidative stress observed in this study are consistent with the previously published reports . in this regard , a methanolic extract of teucrium polium protected red blood cells against lipid peroxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide . in another study , panovska and\ncoworkers   demonstrated that the extracts of teucrium polium prepared using different organic solvents ( diethyl ether , ethyl acetate , and n - butanol ) were effective inhibitors of -carotene oxidation . in another study , it was shown that the extracts prepared from teucrium polium suppressed lipid peroxidation in vitro .\nit is suggested that this high antioxidant activity is due to the phenolic compounds detected in this herb such as hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives , caffeic acid , ferulic acid , and flavonoid derivatives such as luteolin and quercetin .\nit has been reported that teucrium polium ( 200 and 400  mg \/ kg ) prevented the deleterious effects of diabetes on passive avoidance memory , but 100  mg \/ kg of teucrium polium did not have any positive effect on the diabetes - induced memory deficits . in the current study ,\nmemory deficits were prevented by all three doses of teucrium polium ( 100 , 200 , and 400  mg \/ kg ) .\non the other hand , we also indicated that all three doses of teucrium polium significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex suggesting that protection against oxidative stress was probably involved in the learning and memory enhancing properties of the extract .\nin contrast to the beneficial effects of teucrium polium which were mentioned and were seen in the present study , hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects of the plant have also been reported   and should be considered before reaching a final conclusion about the utility of this plant .\nthe role of oxidative stress in complications of diabetes has been studied extensively in experimental diabetes models and diabetic patients [ 63 , 64 ] . due to the hyperglycemia associated with diabetes , enhanced formation of reactive oxygen occurs , which contributes to the increased neuronal death by oxidizing proteins , damaging dna , and augmenting lipid peroxidation [ 10 , 65 ] .\noxidative damage to the rat synapse in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus has been previously reported to contribute to the deficit of cognitive functions [ 8 , 66 ] .\ntherefore , antioxidants might be of general use in the prevention of the neurodegeneration deficits and cognitive impairments associated with diabetes .\nthe present study showed that treatment with teucrium polium prevented the learning and memory deficits associated with stz - induced diabetes .\nthe antioxidant property of teucrium polium may reduce oxidative damage to the synapses in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and therefore improve learning and memory deficits .\nin general , it was found that teucrium polium significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairment in diabetic rats .\nthe exact mechanism of teucrium polium in preventing learning and memory deficits is still in debate . in the current study , both oxidative stress and deficits in learning and memory induced by diabetes\nwere prevented by the treatment with teucrium polium suggesting that oxidative stress was probably involved in the diabetes - induced cognitive deficits which were prevented by teucrium polium extract .","abstract":" \n objective . \n the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of teucrium polium and metformin on diabetes - induced memory impairment and brain tissues oxidative damage were investigated . \n methods . \n the rats were divided into : ( 1 ) control , ( 2 ) diabetic , ( 3 ) diabetic -

of - trial ( from 12-weeks data ) and observed data were obtained for all arms .\nour aim was to propose and validate a model for predicting the dynamic relation between glucose and hba1c within a trial of antidiabetic treatment .\nthe predictive performance was evaluated by estimating the proposed model on 12-week data and predicting end - of - trial ( 2428 weeks ) hba1c .\nthe model was validated on phase iii \/ iv trials to evaluate predictions of hba1c at steady state , which are rarely obtained during earlier phases of clinical drug development .\nthe model was able to predict hba1c at end - of - trial ( 2428 weeks ) with a mean prediction error of 0.14% ranging from 0.01 to 0.24% across the different treatment arms .\nfpg has previously been applied as the main driver for the glycosylation process ; and under the development of the presented model , we compared the performance using fpg and mpg , and mpg was shown to be superior . from a prediction point of view , this was in line with our expectations because ( i ) mpg is derived from more than one glucose measurement making it less sensitive to measurement errors compared with fpg and ( ii ) contrary to mpg , fpg may produce bias for trials where changes in hba1c are mainly resulting from changes in postprandial rather than fasting glucose .\nthe strong predictive performance obtained using mpg observed in our study is further supported by the higher correlation found between mpg and hba1c compared with other glucose measures such as fpg or ppg .\nthe number of samples needed to obtain a robust measure of mpg can vary depending on the meal sizes , frequency , and response of the subjects during the day . a premeal sample and\na postprandial sample at each meal should be sufficient , but an additional sample at bedtime is generally recommended , and it may be considered to take a sample during the night as well . the timing of the measurement of the postprandial glucose is crucial and will be affected by a subject 's response to insulin .\npostprandial glucose peak time is typically reported to be around 1  h for healthy subjects . for type 1 diabetics , lacking endogenous insulin secretion ,\nthe peak time of glucose after a meal will depend on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered exogenous insulin .\nby contrast , in subjects with type 2 diabetes , who typically secrete insulin , a delayed postprandial glucose peak time as well as a prolonged duration of hyperglycemia after a meal will typically be seen .\nthe accuracy of mpg calculation based on a profile with only one postprandial sample will thus be highly sensitive to when it is taken and sampling at suboptimal time may lead to underestimation of both the peak and duration of hyperglycemia .\nwe found slight differences between trials and individuals in both the slope and intercept of the relation between mpg and hba1c at steady state , as shown previously for type 1 diabetes subjects .\nthis led us initially to test models in which kin_hba1c and\/or kout_hba1c were estimated in each arm  but these models resulted in significantly worse end - of - trial hba1c predictions ( from 12-week data ) than the final model , in which these parameters were fixed .\nby contrast , per - individual estimation of the intercept (  in the model ) provided improved predictions , and was thus implemented in the model .\ninvestigation of these changes required inclusion of pretreatment data , which can not be assumed to be at steady state because of short - term changes during the run - in \/ washout period . the inclusion of non  steady - state data thus required the use of a dynamic model rather than a regression model .\nthis flexible initialization was obtained by estimating the pretreatment glucose at steady state ( mpgss ) , which can not be verified by data since sampling of glucose profiles is rarely done at screening .\nclearly , data with 24-h glucose profiles sampled at screening could be valuable to further validate the model of mpgss before treatment .\ntheoretically , hba1c at steady state may depend not only on the corresponding glucose at steady state but also on the patient characteristics . a previous analysis based on continuous glucose profiles performed by nathan et al . investigated whether age , sex\nno difference in the linear relation between the different groups was found . in this analysis\na major part of the recently published models linking glucose to hba1c have also taken into account the turnover of the red blood cells ( rbcs ) .\nthree different approaches have been considered : ( i ) a homogenous life - span model , ( ii ) a random destruction model , and ( iii ) a transit - compartment model , which takes into account variation in life - span of rbc .\na comparison of the models ( based on both clinical data and direct measures of biotin - labeled rbcs ) revealed that an extended version of the transit - compartment model with 12 compartments was superior for description of rbc survival .\nalthough the choice of rbc model was shown to impact predictions of hba1c in a clinical trial , our results suggest that accurate predictions can still be obtained in a population with type 2 diabetes subjects without inclusion of difference in rbc life - span .\nthe presented model differs from previously proposed models in the sense that it is a dynamical model that needs serial samples of both hba1c and mpg to provide successful predictions of hba1c at steady state .\npotentially , the use of more data can improve both the precision and the accuracy of predictions compared with a steady - state solution as the one derived by samtani et al . or a model using solely mpg values .\nthis is a minor issue as the model can estimate and simulate trials with > 500 patients in around 34  h. therefore , we do not consider the implementation of the presented model as a potential bottleneck in a drug - development application .\npotentially , the presented model has both within - study and between - study applications in drug development .\nthus , it is important that the predictive performance is seen in light of what is needed from a drug - development perspective .\none way is to compare with the noninferiority margins of 0.30.4% appearing in the regulatory guidance documents for the development of antidiabetic treatments .\nrelating our results to these criteria , we found the accuracy obtained to be within an acceptable range for direct applications in drug development . for drug - development purposes and decision making\n, it is also important to obtain a correct measure of precision . in our study\n, we did not include parameter uncertainty in predictions , which might be a reason for the higher precision in predictions . including uncertainty in parameter estimates would result in a wider confidence interval , but it is not expected to impact the mean of the individual predictions . within - study prediction using the presented model could support the application of adaptive trial designs . at predefined time points ,\nthe model can be used for hba1c prediction , and decisions could be made , for e.g. , to change dosing , if a dose level is predicted to be inferior .\nsuch a design would , compared with a traditional parallel design , optimize the efficacy information .\nfurthermore , in such a design , it would be possible to maintain some patients on treatment for a long duration and thereby increase the safety information from the trial .\nmoreover , in dose - finding trials where hba1c can not always be assumed to reach steady state , the ability to predict steady - state outcome based on early data would allow improved estimation of the dose  response curve and thus provides a basis for improved dose selection in phase iii trials .\nfurthermore , the use of a longitudinal modeling approach as applied here would ensure that individuals with long \/ short treatment duration will accurately support parameter estimation , thus supporting the improved estimation of complete response in the studied population . in this article , we have evaluated how the presented model can be used to predict within - study hba1c using phase iii \/ iv data .\na future application of the model is to predict hba1c across trials , for e.g. , by predicting the outcome of phase iii trial based on shorter phase ii data . in conclusion ,\nwe have presented and evaluated a model describing the dynamic relation between mpg and hba1c following various antidiabetic treatments .\nthe model predicted hba1c at end - of - trial ( 2428 weeks ) based on 12-week data with high accuracy ( 0.01 to 0.24% prediction error in hba1c in each arm ) and can thus be used as a framework to support trial designs within late - stage drug development in the area of diabetes .\npotentially , the presented model has both within -

dependent parameters that were estimated for each individual , using a log - normal interindividual variability model , where the covariance matrix for the log - transformed parameters was block diagonal with a 2 by 2 block for mpgbase and mpgposttreatment and a 2 by 2 block for mpgss and . correlation between mpgss and  is thought to originate from the inclusion criteria , thus subjects with low mpgss and low  may be excluded due to low hba1c , which may introduce a correlation .\na proportional residual error model was used for both mpg and hba1c . for most trials ,\nfpg was measured more frequently than mpg , e.g. , to facilitate titration of insulin doses .\nthus , it was judged reasonable to utilize these fpg data to more precisely estimate the time course of glucose changes . to convert fpg into mpg , we used a linear relationship between individual fpg and mpg values .\nthis relationship is , however , expected to be treatment and trial dependent , and will thus change from baseline to end - of - trial . to mitigate this error ,\nany fpg value recorded at time points where no 8- to 11-point profiles were taken was transformed into two mpg values , one originating from the time point of the most recent profile and the other from the time point of the next coming profile . the mpg value predicted from the observed fpg value at the relevant time point\n, we evaluated the final model by vpcs expressing median and variability of individual model -

{"article":"the importance of a classification system for the grouping of causes of morbidity or mortality has long been known to be crucial for the study of disease .\nthe first attempt to classify disease systematically has been attributed to francois bossier de lacroix , ( 17061777 ) , better known as sauvages   in his treatise nosologia methodica , written in the 18th century .\nsubsequently , many groups have made attempts to create their own classification systems to compile quantitative data about various diseases within different population groups . in these systems ,\nindividual code categories are assigned to conditions that occur frequently and are associated with significant morbidity ; others are grouped together , often by anatomical site or physiologic system . since the early 1900 's ,\ninternational collaborations have attempted to revise and update these classification systems and this has led to the development of the international classification of diseases , which is now under the direction of the world health organization .\nthe ninth version , known as icd-9 , was published in 1975 and uses a five - digit coding system where the categories are meaningful at the 3-digit level .\nthe icd-9 has become a useful tool for health researchers , as the use of administrative databases in the study of diseases has flourished over the last decade .\nadministrative databases provide a quick and efficient method of eliciting clinical information regarding hospitalization , as compared to the historically used gold standard of chart review .\nthese administrative databases were not intended for research but rather to collect information regarding resource utilization .\nhowever , studies have shown that clinical data extracted from hospital databases in canada provide reliable data when compared to manual chart review .\nthere are limitations to these databases ; it has been suggested that comorbidities in these databases may be underreported for certain codes .\na reorganization of icd-9 codes has been completed for four major chronic conditions ( coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , asthma , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) by a group of researchers for the purpose of creating a consistent research tool for the study of these health problems .\nthese researchers used the consensus of experts in the field and followed the recommendations made by fink et al . .\ntheir recommendations stated that a group consensus should focus on a carefully defined problem that could be investigated in a timely and economical way , that consensus panel members should be representative of their profession , and that decisions on important issues should be justified by available empirically derived data as well as by judgments and experience .\nthe childhood \/ adolescent \/ young adult cancer survivor program ( cayacs ) is a research program investigating late outcomes in survivors of pediatric and young adult cancer through the linkage of administrative databases .\none of the major aims of this program was to analyze hospitalizations in survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer occurring 5 years after the date of diagnosis .\nicd-9 codes reported on the hospital separation forms of 5-year cancer survivors can be linked and compared with controls who did not have childhood cancer . in reviewing the icd-9 coding book\n, it became clear that the categories used in this book were not ideally suited for research into cancer survivorship .\ntherefore , a reclassification of icd-9 coding was needed that was specific for all cancer survivorship issues .\nthe purpose of this paper is to develop this reclassification of the icd-9 codes that can be used by all researchers in cancer survivorship .\nspecifically , this reclassification system can be used by researchers interested in iatrogenic late effects due to therapies given to patients with cancer .\nit can also be used to study the association of cancer with other diseases that may share etiologic determinants .\nfinally , it can also be used in health services research investigating the rates of hospitalizations or medical services use in those who had previously treated cancer .\nthe first step was to review the categories used in the icd-9 and then to decide what categories would be useful for oncology outcome research .\nit was decided to use a category called  other  to group together all codes which were not easily identifiable or did not seem as important for oncology research .\nthe second step was then to create an expert panel which included a radiation oncologist , a pediatric oncologist , and a data coordinator with extensive knowledge in icd-9 coding ( kg , srr , ll ) .\nall 3 members of the panel had experience in survivorship research and were involved in a study using administrative databases to look at long - term outcomes in children treated for cancer ( the cayacs program ) .\nthis panel then systematically reviewed each code in the icd-9 coding book and placed each code into its new category in an excel database .\nthe final step was the transformation of this spreadsheet ( performed by ml ) into a program that reads icd-9 codes from a data file and assigns the correct category using r code ( reference ) , so that this new database could be easily used in future studies .\nthis changed the number of major categories from the 17 found in icd-9 to 39 categories .\nthe categories first used the icd-9 categories served as a backbone and then new categories were created to encompass groups of conditions that would be of interest to those involved in survivorship research . after long discussion , the 2 clinicians involved in the study determined that these were the categories of choice .\nthe reclassification of the icd-9 codes into the new categories is shown in table 2 .\nall the codes from the icd-9 book were able to be incorporated into the new classification groups .\nthe majority of codes were easy to place into the new categories , but there were many codes that did not fit easily into a specific category .\nthe development of the icd-9 codes has enabled health administrators and policy makers to investigate the frequency and causes for hospitalizations across jurisdictions .\nthere has been recent interest in the use of these hospital administrative databases to help answer epidemiological hypotheses .\nhowever , as the coding system is generalized to the entire spectrum of health conditions , it is not ideal for specific groups of interest .\nthis became evident to our cayacs program when we were attempting to use icd-9 codes to analyze causes of hospitalizations in cancer survivors .\nfor instance , causes of infections were scattered throughout the icd-9 coding groupings despite having infection as a major grouping .\nthe hospital 's data coordinator could code an infection based on the pathogen ( codes 001 - 139.8 ) or could code based on the system affected by the infection ( codes scattered throughout the range ) .\nfor a clinical researcher who is interested in all infections in a group of individuals with a specific health condition , the icd-9 code groupings are not suited for this type of research .\nthis becomes even more important when considering a very specific area of research , such as the treatment of cancer and its late outcomes .\nthe purpose of this study was to reclassify the icd-9 codes into practical groupings that can be used by a health researcher specifically for cancer follow - up outcomes .\nthis study has therefore reclassified the icd-9 codes into categories which are useful to those involved in oncology research using administrative databases .\nthis reclassification system can be used by all groups looking at causes of hospitalization in those diagnosed with cancer , whether these patients are on active treatment or are in posttherapy surveillance as long - term survivors .\nall the codes in icd-9 are accounted for and have been placed into specific categories .\nfor instance , within the cardiovascular system it is important to distinguish hypertension , myocardial infarction , arrhythmias , valvular disease and cardiomyopathy from each other , as each subcategory would likely have differing attributable factors and risks . by separating out these different conditions\n, we can study the the long - term risk of hospitalization associated with different initial childhood cancer diagnoses and therapies .\nwe can for example , measure the risk of hospitalization for different cardiac conditions in long - term survivors treated for childhood hodgkin lymphoma treated with mantle radiotherapy .  \na strength of this study is that consensus was easily achieved for all icd-9 codes between the 3 members of the panel .\nthe inclusion of a senior data coordinator who has extensive experience and expertise in coding in hospital discharges gave insight into the practicality of coding .\nas all 3 members of the panel are involved in survivorship research , the new classification scheme was based on experience with data derived from icd9-coding .\nthe main limitation of this study is that it represents the opinion of only one group of clinicians .\ncertainly others may have a few subtle changes they would suggest to the classifications or the categories in general .\nby our accounts this is the first reclassification of the icd-9 codes into new diagnostic groupings that are more useful for the clinical researcher .\nmoreover , this new classification system is ideal for oncology - specific outcomes and can therefore be used by all researchers in the study of cancer treatment and survivorship .\ns. r. rassekh   conceived the study , participated in the design , was on the expert panel that performed the reclassification , and drafted the manuscript .\nm. lorenzi helped design the study , created all the tables , and helped draft the manuscript .\nl. lee helped design the study and was on the expert panel that performed the reclassification and helped draft the manuscript .\nm. mcbride helped design the study , is the primary investigator of the cayacs project which helped fund this study , and helped draft the manuscript .\nk. goddard helped to conceive the study , participated in the design , was on the expert panel that performed the reclassification , and helped draft the manuscript .","abstract":" \n background . the international classification of disease , ninth revision ( icd-9 ) is designed to code disease into categories which are placed into administrative databases . \n these databases have been used for epidemiological studies . however , the categories used in the icd9-codes are not always the most effective for evaluating specific diseases or their outcomes , such as the outcomes of cancer treatment . \n therefore a re -

[2] he proposed a classification on the basis of a series of four questions, e.g., about the structure, origin and evolution of the morbific agent, the nature of the morbid process, the seat of the morbific process, and the clinical symptoms. on the basis of these four questions, mackenzie differentiated 19 groups (table 1).\nthe last attempt to provide a classification was made by mackenzie himself in 1861. he differentiated 28 classes, subclasses and subdivisions. the most important of his proposals is the four-quadrant classification which he described in detail in his book"}

{"article":"osteoporosis is a frequently occurring disease in postmenopausal women , characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue , resulting in increased bone fragility and fracture risk.1,2 osteoporotic fractures commonly occur at the hip , spine , and forearm , with vertebral fractures being the most frequent.3 of all patients who sustain a vertebral fracture , it is estimated that 20% will suffer a new vertebral fracture within 1 year.4 of all osteoporotic fractures , hip fractures are the most serious , with an elevated mortality risk as well as a high hospital burden in spain.5 osteoporosis has been a growing economic issue due to the increased number of fractures during the last 20 years , combined with the development of novel agents for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.6 aside from the economic consequences , osteoporosis also has a negative impact on quality of life for the affected individual.7 the high impact of these socioeconomic consequences makes osteoporosis a high priority health problem . over the last decade ,\nalthough existing therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis have been shown to be effective , they may not be appropriate for all women because of concerns related to safety and\/or tolerability.8,9 one of the currently available therapies is raloxifene , a selective estrogen receptor modulator ( serm ) that has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women.10 another selective estrogen receptor modulator , bazedoxifene , has been shown to prevent bone loss and to decrease bone turnover , with a favorable endometrial , ovarian , and breast safety profile in a 2 year , phase iii study of postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis.1113 a 3 year , global phase iii study in osteoporotic women aged 55 years , ie , the osteoporosis study,14 compared bazedoxifene with placebo and raloxifene .\nbazedoxifene and raloxifene both reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo . in a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients at higher risk ,\nbazedoxifene significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo and raloxifene.14 higher - risk patients were defined as women with a femoral neck t score 3.0 and\/or at least a moderate to severe vertebral fracture or multiple mild vertebral fractures .\nmany participants in the osteoporosis study participated in a 2 year extension study in which bazedoxifene showed sustained efficacy in preventing fractures over 5 years of therapy.15 approximately two million women were estimated to have osteoporosis in spain in 2010.16 it is important to evaluate both clinical and economic implications with the introduction of a new treatment , given that treating this population is associated with a high socioeconomic burden .\nclinical aspects are normally investigated in clinical trials within a controlled setting and a limited time frame . in the case of osteoporosis ,\neconomic modeling is necessary to study the long - term consequences of fracture risk reduction beyond the time frames of clinical trials . in spain\n, several studies have investigated the socioeconomic impact of treatment of osteoporosis to the spanish national health service , as well as for patients.1720 cost - effectiveness analyses of osteoporosis vary considerably between countries.18 different tools are being used to estimate fracture risk , which can significantly impact the cost - effectiveness of treatment .\na recent cost - effectiveness analysis comparing bazedoxifene with placebo used the frax tool ( world health organization collaborating centre for metabolic bone diseases , university of sheffield , sheffield , uk ) that provides fracture probabilities for specific populations.18 although frax can be used to predict the probability of hip or other major osteoporotic fractures , the criteria should not be generalized to other countries having different fracture incidence rates and health care costs.21 therefore , when comparing the cost - effectiveness of bazedoxifene with raloxifene in spanish women with osteoporosis , it is important to take into account that the incidence of fractures is different between southern european countries and countries in the scandinavian region.22,23 the objective of this study was to compare the cost - effectiveness of bazedoxifene and raloxifene in the prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in women diagnosed with osteoporosis .\nthe computer simulation model in microsoft ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa , usa ) excel used to calculate cost - effectiveness was an updated markov model that has been used previously to estimate the cost - effectiveness of bazedoxifene incorporating the frax algorithm from a european perspective.18 the model represented the transition of a cohort of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and aged 55 years through various health states with occurrence of events based on yearly probabilities .\nthe starting age was based on women recruited for a 3 year clinical study of bazedoxifene.14 the analysis was performed from the health care perspective , following all patients from initiation of treatment until they were 82 years of age and had received bazedoxifene or raloxifene for this 27-year time period .\nall patients began in the  well health  or  no event state  . in each cycle , a patient had a probability of sustaining a fracture , remaining healthy , or dying .\nafter 1 year in any fracture state , the patient had a risk of sustaining a new fracture or dying .\nif a patient died , she would move to the dead -

effectiveness of bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene in postmenopausal spanish women with osteoporosis using effectiveness data from the osteoporosis study.14 the results of this study indicate that bazedoxifene was the dominant treatment strategy compared with raloxifene for the prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in high - risk postmenopausal osteoporotic women aged 5582 years .\ntreatment with bazedoxifene demonstrated a higher probability of being cost - effective than treatment with raloxifene up to a maximum of  50,000 for willingness to pay for an additional qaly gained .\nalthough no guidelines are available in spain to determine whether an intervention can be considered cost - effective , a nonofficial threshold of  30,000 for a qaly is considered acceptable , and compares favorably with other medical and surgical procedures.35 when this threshold is taken into account , bazedoxifene was a cost - effective treatment option compared with raloxifene .\nany conclusions from this study need to be placed into the context of assumptions made for this model .\nimportant issues to consider are the epidemiology , morbidity , and mortality associated with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures , as well as adverse events arising from both treatments .\nthese issues have been addressed as much as possible by assuming conservative scenarios or by including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis .\nthe general conclusions of this study are primarily based on vertebral and nonvertebral fracture outcomes and the effect of adverse events associated with both treatments . from our results , it is apparent that the effect of treatment on fracture risk and adverse events related to both treatments are important drivers for cost - effectiveness . in the base case ,\ntreatment effects for the prevention of vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures with or without previous fractures were based on a head - to - head comparison of bazedoxifene with raloxifene.14 relative risk reductions for vertebral fractures were higher for the raloxifene cohort , although relative risks were lower for patients in the bazedoxifene cohort who had sustained earlier vertebral and nonvertebral fractures .\ndifferences in relative risk reduction for nonvertebral fractures after prior fractures were larger and more favorable for bazedoxifene .\nno treatment effect was assumed for nonvertebral fractures in patients without fractures because the fracture incidence did not differ significantly from placebo.14 similar results were found comparing raloxifene with placebo in the multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation study.10 if effects on nonvertebral fractures in patients without prior fractures were included , these could further improve cost - effectiveness .\nadverse events associated with both treatments were obtained from the osteoporosis study.14 the main effect observed was a decrease in quality of life for affected patients and associated treatment costs incurred by patients .\nsimilar findings for loss of quality of life because of adverse events were reported in studies of raloxifene.10,36 an increased incidence of venous thrombolytic events , primarily deep vein thrombosis , was observed in the bazedoxifene and raloxifene groups , a finding consistent with that reported in earlier studies.36,37 further , bazedoxifene was associated with a lower incidence of breast cyst \/ fibrocystic breast disease compared with raloxifene .\nall adverse events were assumed to cause a 10% decrease in quality of life in the first year and subsequent years because appropriate estimates for utility loss were lacking in the literature . when the utilities were corrected for decrease in quality of life , the qaly gain was higher for the bazedoxifene cohort , leading to better cost - effectiveness .\nthe incidence of breast cancer in the study reported by silverman et al14 was low for bazedoxifene and raloxifene , and no significant differences were observed in the incidence of breast cancer between the treatment groups . in the same study,14 treatment with bazedoxifene was associated with fewer cases of breast cancer than treatment with raloxifene over a period of 3 years , although these results were not significant .\nthese results contrast with previous reports that raloxifene is associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk.3739 although different studies , as mentioned before , report possible effects of bazedoxifene and raloxifene on risk of breast cancer , any decrease in quality of life due to breast cancer for the second and following years after having breast cancer , as reported by zethraeus et al,40 has not been included in this model . including decrease in quality of life because of\nbreast cancer , might affect the cost - effectiveness ratio , and would improve for bazedoxifene based on the lower number of cases observed , as was seen in the study reported by silverman et al.14 an important strength of this study is that data on incidence of events , post - event mortality , and costs were country - specific .\nwe only included patients who sustained a vertebral or nonvertebral fracture , and there were no data included for patients who could have sustained multiple fractures simultaneously .\ntherefore , the effect of multiple fractures in terms of costs and quality of life could not be determined .\nregarding data on quality of life , a limitation of this study was the lack of references for loss of quality of life as a result of adverse events , such as leg cramps and breast cysts \/ fibrocystic breast disease .\ndecrease in quality of life because of deep vein thrombosis was based on assumptions made in previous studies,28,29 although supportive evidence was lacking .\nalthough data on adherence are available for raloxifene,41 no data outside of clinical trials are available for bazedoxifene .\noverall adherence with treatment for osteoporosis has been shown to be poor.42,43 as a consequence of nonoptimal persistence , the number of fractures avoided could be reduced , results in less qaly gain for the treatment population .\nanother effect is the reduction in intervention costs when treatment is stopped before the planned treatment duration .\ntherefore , less persistence could lead to less effectiveness , which might be compensated for somewhat by lower intervention costs , meaning persistence is likely to have a small effect on cost - effectiveness ratios , which is in line with the results of jonsson et al.44 whether bazedoxifene is a cost - effective treatment depends largely on the probability of having a nonvertebral fracture , sustaining a subsequent nonvertebral fracture , and decreased quality of life due to adverse events , as well as the amount the spanish national health service is willing to pay for a qaly gained .\nbazedoxifene compared with raloxifene in this study was shown to fall below the threshold of  30,000 for an intervention that demonstrates typical benefits in spain .\nit is important to recognize that the present study was undertaken in a spanish setting and that the results are not automatically applicable elsewhere , given that fracture risk , mortality , and costs may differ from country to country .\nbazedoxifene was shown to be a cost - effective treatment option for the prevention and treatment of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporotic women with a high fracture risk in spain . when comparing bazedoxifene with raloxifene , it may be concluded that bazedoxifene is the dominant treatment strategy .\nresults of probabilistic sensitivity analysis show that the choice of the optimal strategy of bazedoxifene is independent of the maximum that the spanish national health service is willing to pay per additional qaly .\nbazedoxifene demonstrated a slightly higher probability of being cost - effective for all threshold values .","abstract":" backgroundthe purpose of this study was to assess the cost - effectiveness of bazedoxifene and raloxifene for prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures among postmenopausal spanish women aged 5582 years with established osteoporosis and a high fracture risk.methodsa markov model was developed to represent the transition of a cohort of postmenopausal osteoporotic women through different health states , ie , patients free of fractures , patients with vertebral or nonvertebral fractures , and patients recovered from a fracture . efficacy data for bazedoxifene were obtained from the osteoporosis study . \n the perspective of the spanish national health service was chosen with a time horizon of 27 years . \n costs were reported in 2010 euros . \n deterministic results were presented as expected cost per quality -

The primary purpose of measuring serum markers of bone resorption is to determine the presence of skeletal disorders, and to follow the therapeutic response to therapy. Several research groups have tried to investigate the best combination of biochemical markers for diagnosis and monitoring the efficacy of therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.5\u20137 Despite several studies, no consensus has been reached as to which markers are best in discriminating osteoporosis from normal bone, and which markers are most sensitive and specific for osteoporosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the possible use of biochemical markers of bone resorption for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Biochemical markers in osteoporotic women were evaluated against markers in normal subjects, and in turn compared with serum BAP and CTX to assess their usefulness for diagnosing osteoporosis.\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty postmenopausal women (mean age 54.1 \u00b1 3.8) with osteoporotic fractures and 20 normal control subjects (mean age 53.1 \u00b1 4.9) were enrolled in this case-control study. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of our institution and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Women with a history of fracture, rheumatic disease, hyperthyroidism, cancer, and those currently taking medication were excluded from the study. Exclusion criteria included a history of fracture in the preceding year or on the day of the examination, and a history of a previous hip or vertebral fracture within 5 years of the present study. For each subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were verified in writing.\n\nBiochemical tests were performed on fasting blood samples and included serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteoprotegerin, BSP, CTX, OC, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) as biochemical markers of bone resorption. The bone alkaline phosphatase was assessed by a quantitative sandwich immunoassay based on the BAP specific-antibody (Abcam"}
{"article":"chronic cough is a persistent and frustrating symptom for many adults and children and a frequent reason for primary or secondary care visits or referrals .\nthis condition generates significant healthcare and economic cost and is associated with a spectrum of disorders across multiple medical specialties and can provide significant challenges for the involved physician or surgeon .\nchronic cough is associated with deterioration in the quality of patients ' lives . associated symptoms and negative outcomes with this condition include loss of sleep , exhaustion , irritability , urinary incontinence , cough syncope , social disability , and inability to perform daily activities .\nmany patients experience chronic cough secondary to another medical condition , such as copd , asthma , rhinosinusitis , gastroesophageal reflux syndrome ( gerd ) , postnasal drip syndrome ( pnds ) , or unknown etiology .\ngerd is thought to be the most common cause of chronic cough in a nonsmoker nonasthmatic individual .\nthe otolaryngologist should be familiar with the diagnostic algorithm of chronic cough patients and should work closely with the gastroenterologist and the pulmonologist , ideally in  cough clinics ,  to confidently diagnose and treat these patients .\nchronic nonspecific cough , defined as a nonproductive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known cause   persisting for more than three to eight weeks , poses a significant burden to healthcare costs and considerably impairs quality of life .\ngastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) represents one of the three main causes of chronic cough ( along with asthma and upper airways cough \/ postnasal drip syndrome ) , implicated in up to 41% of chronic cough patients .\nthe clinical features of gerd - related cough include heartburn , regurgitation , and\/or worsening of cough after foods or medications known to decrease lower esophageal sphincter - pressure , with extraesophageal manifestations such as hoarseness , wheezing , sore throat , chest pain , and globus also described .\nwhilst classic gerd symptoms are present in 610% of chronic cough patients , gerd is clinically silent in up to 75% of patients with gerd - related cough .\ndiagnosis of gerd is frequently based on the clinical responses of cough to antireflux therapy rather than on objective assessments of gerd per se .\nfurthermore , an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of gerd and in particular the specific phenomenon of laryngopharyngeal reflux ( lpr ) , has highlighted the complexity of this condition , with the need for individual patients assessment and tailoring of therapy becoming apparent .\nthe regurgitation of gastric contents into the laryngopharynx can cause mechanical or ph - sensitive stimulation , with chronic inflammation leading to the sensitisation of peripheral nerves mediating cough .\nthis may have an acid or nonacid ( namely , bile and pepsin ) basis .\nadhami et al .   demonstrated that bile can injure the laryngeal epithelium but only in an acidic environment , and furthermore , sasaki et al .  \nwere able to demonstrate histological laryngeal injury in a rat model following bile exposure in neutral environments .\npepsin , the principal proteolytic enzyme of the stomach , is predominantly active in acidic ph and has been shown to cause laryngeal injury in this state ; however proteolytic activity is still present up to ph 7 and can be reactivated .\nfound the presence of pepsin in the larynx of patients with the clinical diagnosis of lpr but not in controls and in these same patients , pepsin was absent in their esophageal epithelium .\nmicro  or  silent  aspiration , caused by the direct activation of tracheo - bronchial receptors by reflux entering the airway .\ndistal esophageal reflux may also induce coughing through vagal stimulation known as the oesophago - bronchial reflex , ing et al .\nadditionally whilst infusion of acid ( compared to saline ) into the oesophagus of those gerd patients without chronic cough had no effect , a sensitised cough reflex to capsaicin was seen in those gerd patients with chronic cough .\nan alternative pathophysiology is that coughing can in fact be the causation in reflux : increased intra - abdominal pressure during strenuous coughing episodes negatively impacting the lower esophageal sphincter , possibly by way of a positive feedback loop .  \nas discussed above , reflux associated cough can be a laryngopharyngeal or distal esophageal phenomena .\ncombined reported series of 899 patients , throat clearing was a complaint of 87% of lpr patients versus 3% of those with gerd , while only 20% of lpr patients complained of heartburn versus 83% in the gerd group .\ndifferences in body mass index ( bmi ) between gerd and lpr patients have also been highlighted ; in a retrospective study of 500 patients attending for ph probe studies , the mean bmi of isolated lpr patients was 25.9 compared to 28.3 for those with gerd .   identifying gerd as the cause of a chronic cough can be challenging .\nesophageal ph testing can demonstrate an increased number of reflux events , prolonged exposure of the esophageal mucosa to reflux , or more convincingly a significant temporal association between reflux events and cough .\nalthough esophageal ph testing has a sensitivity of approximately 90% for the evaluation of chronic cough , specificity ranges from 66% to 100% [ 15 , 16 ] .\nadditional diagnostic tests include inhaled tussigenic challenges , endoscopy , examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and\/or sputum for lipid laden macrophages , barium swallow , bernstein test , radioisotope scintiscan , and radionucleotide emptying studies with solids .\nexamination of the larynx may reveal evidence of lpr : key examination findings being vocal cord oedema and erythema as well as medial vocal cord erythema [ 18 , 19 ] .\nfindings should , however , be taken in context : hicks and colleagues finding that almost 80% of study participants had a least one reflux - attributable finding on laryngoscopy when 100 healthy volunteers were examined .\ndietary advice includes the avoidance of a high - fat diet and losing weight if obese , avoiding eating two hours before bedtime and refraining from caffeine , carbonated drinks , alcohol , and citrus products .\npatients should also be asked to refrain from smoking and elevate the head of the bed by 15  cm .\nsome medications are associated with increase gerd , namely , anticholinergics , beta - agonists , bisphosphonates , calcium - channel blocker , corticosteroids , benzodiazepines , oestrogens , opiates , progesterone , prostaglandins , and theophylline .\nother recommendations include nasal continuous positive airway pressure if obstructive sleep apnoea is present   and avoiding exercise that may increase intra - abdominal pressure .\nproton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) have commonly been the mainstay empirical treatment for gerd - related cough .\ngiven the difficulty in clearly diagnosing this condition , irwin   has described the clinical profile of such patients in whom empirical therapy should be considered ; those not exposed to environmental irritants , not a present smoker , not on an ace inhibitor , with a normal \/ stable chest radiograph , and in whom symptomatic asthma , upper airways cough syndrome , and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis has been ruled out .\nthe use of empirical therapy has , however , been questioned . in a meta - analysis of 5 randomised controlled trials on gerd treatment for cough in adults and children without primary lung disease , chang et al .  \nfound that there was no difference in cough resolution for patients who received a placebo versus a ppi ( or 0.24 ( 95% ci 0.04 to 1.27 ) .\nthere was , however , a significant difference in secondary outcomes of mean cough score ( mean difference of 0.51 ( 1.02 to 0.01 ) ) and change in cough score ( 0.29 ( 0.62 to 0.04 ) ) at the end of the trial .\nthis led the authors to conclude that the use of ppi had  some effect in some adults .\n more recently , a cochrane database systematic review by chang and colleagues   including 9 randomised controlled trials of ppis for adults with chronic cough found that using intention - to - treat , pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough ( or 0.46 ; 95% ci 0.19 to 1.15 no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes ( end of trial or change in cough scores ) .\nthere was , however , a significant improvement in cough scores at end of intervention ( two to three months ) in those receiving ppi ( standardised mean difference 0.41 ; 95% ci 0.75 to 0.07 ) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross - over trials .\nthe authors were unable to conclude definitely that gerd treatment with ppis is universally beneficial for cough associated with gerd . despite the current lack of evidence for definite treatment of empiric treatment , published guidelines from the accp   and bts   suggest that ppi therapy should be commenced , for example , omeprazole 2040  mg twice daily or equivalent taken before meals for at least 8 weeks .  \nof particular interest in nonacidic refux , medications such as gaviscon or gaviscon advance , which act by forming a raft or physical barrier to reflux present a supplementary or even alternative treatment option .\nconducted a randomised controlled trial of gaviscon advance in 49 patients with a diagnosis lpr ( based on the reflux symptom index ( rsi ) and the reflux findings score ( rfs ) ) .\npatients were assessed pretreatment and at 2 , 4 , and 6 months after treatment .\nsignificant differences in the mean ( sd ) between treatment and control were observed for rsi at the 2-month ( 11.2 ( 7.0 ) versus 16.8 ( 6.4 ) , p = 0.005 ) and 6-month ( 11.2 ( 8.1 ) versus 18.3 ( 9.4 ) , p = 0.008 ) assessments and for rfs at the 6-month ( 7.1 ( 2.8 ) versus 9.5 ( 3.4 ) , p = 0.005 ) assessment .\nthe details of the cough component of the rsi were not , however , detailed further in the report .\ngastroesophageal dysmotility has been implicated in the pathophysiology of gerd via abnormalities of delayed gastric emptying and reduced pressure or inappropriate transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter .\nseveral prokinetic agents ( e.g. , bethanechol , metoclopramide , domperidone , cisapride , and macrolides such as erythromycin ) can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and have , therefore , been proposed as useful adjuncts to antireflux medication .\nthe evidence base for this lies only in unblinded , uncontrolled studies , where , when in combination ppis for treating gerd - associated cough , cough or hoarseness improved by 70% to 100% [ 10 , 2831 ] . in the recent cochrane review , chang et al\n.   found insufficient data to evaluate the evidence for the use of prokinetic agents in chronic cough .\nhowever , interestingly in 56 patients diagnosed with gerd - related cough , 24 responded to a ppi alone ; however , 18 of the remaining patients improved with the addition of metoclopramide or cisapride . these drugs\n, however , may have significant side - effects : erythromycin , for example , often causes nausea and abdominal pain and cisapride was withdrawn from the us market due to safety concerns .\nalthough surgery is more traditionally used to treat the more typical reflux symptoms , it may be of some value in the management of reflux - related cough .\nstudies relating to the outcomes of surgical treatment of gerd are , however , of questionable value as they suffer from lack of controls and blinding , use differing postoperative evaluation criteria , and are typically based on a highly selective group of patients .\nkaufman and colleagues   reported their long - term ( mean 53 months ) outcomes of 128 patients treated with laparoscopic antireflux surgery .\ncough and hoarseness was improved in 65% to 75% of cases compared to heartburn and regurgitation in over 90% of subjects . in their review of treatment options for gerd - related cough ,\nchandra and harding   summarised the finding of 9 prospective studies of surgical management , reporting that 586 of 689 surgically treated patients had a\n gerd remains one of the leading causes of chronic cough ; however , the difficulty in diagnosing this condition , especially as  classic  reflux symptoms are often absent means that it can be overlooked .\nthe mainstay of treatment , for now , remains as lifestyle modification , dietary advice , and medical therapy .\nthe role of traditional empirical treatment with ppis is questionable , with evidence from randomised trials implying that there is some benefit in the right patient group .\nidentifying this patient group is , therefore , imperative : careful clinical history taking and laryngeal evaluation along with objective reflux assessment being key .\nthe use of alginate preparations seems to be quite popular in the last few years , although evidence is currently lacking .\nsurgical management , although not as useful for cough symptomatology as for classic symptoms also has a role in patients resistant to medical therapy .\npostnasal drip ( pnd ) or catarrh is the drainage of secretions from the nose or paranasal sinuses into the pharynx .\nclinically , the diagnosis of pnd syndrome ( pnds ) is very vague , made on history and examination and relies on the reporting of the patient of this sensation of something  dripping down the throat ,  rhinorrhoea and constant throat clearing .\nnasendoscopy revealing rhinitis and mucopurulent secretions is suggestive , although not diagnostic . the issues when attempting to diagnose pnds ,\nis that there are no objective sensitive or specific tests and no way to quantify the amount of catarrh or to prove that it is directly responsible for causing cough .\npnds is associated with very nonspecific symptoms and a definitive diagnosis of pnd - induced cough can not be made from the history and examination findings alone .\nthe differential diagnosis of pnds - induced cough includes all other causes of rhinitis including , allergic rhinitis , perennial nonallergic rhinitis , bacterial sinusitis , allergic fungal sinusitis , rhinitis due to anatomic sinonasal abnormalities , rhinitis due to physical or chemical irritants , occupational rhinitis , rhinitis medicamentosa , and rhinitis of pregnancy .\nanother issue when attempting to diagnose pnds - induced cough is that gerd is often associated with a high prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms and therefore can either coexist or mimic pnds .\nthe introduction of the - more widely accepted in americas - term of  upper airway cough syndrome  ( uacs ) was made based on the need to answer the question whether  the conditions listed above actually produce cough through a final common pathway of pnd or whether , in fact , in some circumstances they cause irritation or inflammation of upper airway structures that directly stimulate cough receptors and produce cough independently of or in addition to any associated pnd  .  \nit is obvious that because there are no objective tests for diagnosing pnd , treatment is often based on the specific disease that is present .\nfor example , avoidance of specific allergens after allergy testing has been done , nasal steroid treatment and antihistamines , treatment of concomitant infection , and correction of any associated sinonasal anatomical abnormalities can have an indirect effect on the management of pnd - induced cough .\nthe american college of chest physicians recommends an empiric trial of therapy for uacs because improvement or resolution of cough in response to specific treatment is the pivotal factor in confirming the diagnosis of uacs as a cause of cough .\nthat should especially be the case if no specific cause can be elicited from the history and examination .  \nif a patient has resolution or partial resolution of cough , then uacs is considered to have been a cause of cough and antihistamine therapy is continued .\nmarked improvement or resolution of cough may take several weeks and occasionally as long as a few months .  \nif there is no response with a first - generation antihistamine , then the patient should undergo sinus imaging .\nchronic sinusitis causes a productive cough or can be clinically silent , in that the cough can be nonproductive , and none of the typical findings associated with acute sinusitis may be present [ 36 , 38 ] .   allergy skin testing , measurement of serum ig levels to see whether ( acquired ) hypogammaglobulinemia is present , evaluation of the patient 's home and workplace if there is a potential environmental cause for persistent upper airway symptom are all reasonable diagnostic strategies especially if there is lack of response to sinusitis treatment .\nif nasendoscopy reveals nasal polyps , in the absence of any contraindication , the patient should undergo a standard aspirin challenge .\nif the results of the challenge are positive , the patient should undergo desensitization , followed by the consideration of chronic aspirin therapy unless it is contraindicated .\nchronic cough can be associated with many diseases that often overlap more than one medical specialty .\na detailed assessment of the patient with chronic cough relies on a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between pulmonary medicine , gastroenterology , and otolaryngology .\ngastrooesophageal reflux and postnasal drip syndrome account for a significant number of cases of chronic nonproductive cough seen in otolaryngology practice .\neach may , alone or in combinationcontribute to cough even when clinically silent , and failure to recognise their contribution may lead to unsuccessful treatment .\nmany of these patients are notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat but the literature suggests that a systematic and thorough approach in a multidisciplinary setting can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment in the majority of patients .","abstract":" \n objectives . chronic cough is a multifactorial symptom that requires multidisciplinary approach . over the last years , general practitioners refer increasingly more chronic cough patients directly to the otolaryngologist . \n the aim of this paper is to highlight the issues in diagnosis and management of chronic cough patients from the otolaryngologist perspective . \n design . literature review . results . \n gastroesophageal reflux and postnasal drip syndrome remain one of the most common causes of chronic cough . \n better diagnostic modalities , noninvasive tests , and high technology radiological and endoscopic innovations have made diagnosis of these difficult -

cd40\/il-4 yielded 63 igg1- and 42 igg1-producing hybridomas ( table i ) . in the absence of s1 , we did not find any igg1-producing hybridomas ( 0 igg1 and 160 igg1 hybridomas ) , as expected ( 7 ) . compared with the control ,\nthe relative ratio of igg1\/igg1 hybridomas was 31% in 2-ss1 , 30% in 2-ss3 , and 47% in 2-s3 , respectively .\ntherefore , the levels of csr to alleles in which s1 sequences were replaced with endogenous or synthetic s3 sequences was at least as high as those to alleles in which s1 was replaced with synthetic s1 .\nrelative csr frequency is defined by the ratio of igg1- to igg1-producing hybridomas and is arbitrarily set as 100% for f1 cells\nthe data for wt and 2-ss1 were adopted from our previous study ( reference 9 ) .\nalthough the levels of csr supported by the 2-s3 replacement alleles appeared slightly higher in both the elisa and hybridoma analyses , the differences in the elisa analyses were not statistically significant . determining whether or not there is a slight preference for the 2-s3 sequences would require further study . however , inversion of each type of inserted s region sequence clearly resulted in substantially decreased igh class switching to igg1 ( fig . 3 and table i ) , potentially caused by decreased r loop formation in the inverse direction ( 7 , 9 , 13 ) .\nfinally , we used a nested pcr approach to map s to ss3 junctions in igg1-producing hybridomas .\nalthough four out of eight junctions ( 50% ) fell into a gagct motif surrounded by g nucleotides , further mutational studies on synthetic s regions would be required to identify the motifs that are preferentially targeted during csr in vivo . given the central role of igh isotype class switching in the humoral immunity , it is of significant interest to identify the mechanisms that contribute to the specificity of this process .\nspecific factors may be required for targeting csr to s3 versus s1 , and vice versa ( 24 ) . in this report\n, we show that synthetic or wt s3 , or size - matched s1 sequences , when inserted in place of the endogenous s1 , can mediate roughly similar levels of csr under b cell activation conditions in which csr to the endogenous s1 , but not the endogenous s3 , is induced .\nwe have previously shown that the xenopus s sequence , when substituted for the mouse s1 region , can mediate csr at substantial levels , even though it is at rich and lacks the ability to form an r loop structure in vitro ( 13 ) and in vivo ( leiber , m. , personal communication ) .\nthus , our previous xenopus s replacement study ( 13 ) complements our current findings ; collectively , these studies strongly indicate that nucleotide sequence differences between s1 and other s regions are not likely to be major determinants of endogenous igg1 csr targeting .\ncorrespondingly , our current findings support germline transcriptional activation of the s1 region as the primary mechanism for targeting csr to igg1 ( 28 , 29 ) . in this context , the finding that s3 sequences in place of s1 sequences do not support csr to igg1 under conditions ( lps activation ) in which igg3 csr is induced would reflect the fact that lps fails to induce germline transcription of the c1 gene promoter . finally , we note that our approach now can be used to test for potential roles of putative s region  specific factors in mediating specific csr events to other s regions under other stimulation conditions ( 21 , 24 ) .\nto generate synthetic s3 , the consensus s3 ( 5-ggatccggggagctggggtaggttgggagtgtggggaccaggctgggcagctctgagatct-3 ; bamhi and bglii sites are underlined ; reference 26 ) was oligomerized by sequential cloning into the bamhi site of s85 vector to generate 2-ss3 ( fig .\nthe 2-ss3 sequence was excised as a noti and sali fragment and cloned into the targeting construct previously described ( 9 ) .\nthe endogenous s3 region was excised as a bamhi \/ noti fragment from psv5 plasmid ( provided by a. kenter , university of illinois at chicago , chicago , il ) and cloned into pbluescript .\nsubsequently , the noti \/ sali fragment was ligated into the targeting vector as previously described ( 9 ) .\nthe targeting constructs were transfected into es cells in which the s1 was deleted ( 7 ) .\nthe targeted es cells were identified by southern blotting as described in fig . 1 b ( 13 ) .\nthe deletion of the neo gene was achieved by infecting es cells with cre -

{"article":"the pathogenesis of the ophthalmopathy that occurs in approximately 40% of patients with graves hyperthyroidism1 and , less often and usually in a less severe form , in 25% of patients with hashimoto thyroiditis2 remains controversial.3,4 while most authors favor the hypothesis that autoimmunity against the tsh receptor ( tshr ) expressed in the orbital fibroblasts , preadipocytes , and fibrocytes is the dominant autoimmune reaction that leads to orbital inflammation57 not all the evidence supports this , namely , graves disease and worsening ophthalmopathy may be associated with decreasing levels of tshr antibodies in individual patients ( wall et al , 2013 , unpublished observations ) and ophthalmopathy may develop many years after the onset of hyperthyroidism .\nmost importantly , patients with so - called euthyroid graves disease8 have a similar ophthalmopathy but no evidence for thyroid autoimmunity including negative tshr antibodies as measured in the trab assay and as thyroid - stimulating immunoglobulin in a thyreporter bio - assay,9 suggesting that other possibilities should be considered .\nmoreover on a recent case report we showed that eye signs and other soft tissue manifestations of graves disease worsened in the context of psychological stress , with reduced levels of tshr antibody , occurred following stress.10 regardless of the nature of the inflammatory process in the orbital connective tissue and fat and extra ocular muscles ( eom ) , the eye disorder is presumed to begin in the thyroid since the great majority of patients with graves ophthalmopathy ( go ) have active thyroid inflammation , ie , thyroiditis , at the time they develop eye signs.1,11 thus , a logical hypothesis for the orbital reaction is that thyroid antigens are released in the context of a thyroiditis and travel (  home  ) to the orbital tissues where they bind to various cell types and are targeted by autoantibodies and\/or sensitized t cells , leading to orbital inflammation .\nthis is the working hypothesis for most groups working on ophthalmopathy and has been well studied for the tshr , but the possible role of the other major thyroid antigen , thyroglobulin ( tg ) , has been largely ignored .\nan earlier hypothesis for the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with graves hyperthyroidism was developed by konishi et al12 and mcdougall and kriss13 and based on the notion that tg released from the thyroid gland might pass to the orbit via the putative lymphatics that link the thyroid to the orbit , where it could be recognized by tg autoantibodies leading to orbital inflammation .\nfeldt - rasmussen et al demonstrated the presence of tg in the orbit but the presence of tg \/ anti - tg immune complexes has not been reported .\nserum anti - tg antibodies did not correlate closely with severity of the eye disease in one study.14 subsequently , using a panel of well - characterized monoclonal antibodies against tg and patients sera , we demonstrated reactivity against a human orbital connective tissue membrane protein which correlated with serum anti - tg antibody levels but not ophthalmopathy.15 we concluded that the orbital protein was not native tg but another putative thyroid and orbital tissue shared antigen .\nin retrospect , these early studies had partly confirmed the hypothesis of mcdougall and kriss.13 later , we carried out further studies with anti - tg monoclonal antibodies to test for the presence of tg in orbital tissues from patients with go and , as controls , from patients undergoing orbital surgery for non - immunological disorders .\nhowever , we could not identify intact tg in the orbit.16 goh et al17 found that ophthalmopathy tended to be associated with lower titers of tg and tpo antibodies in patients with graves disease compared to those without eye involvement . although they postulated that tg antibodies somehow protected against ophthalmopathy , an alternative explanation is that serum antibodies are decreased in the circulation because they are absorbed out by tg in the orbital tissues .\nthe  tg hypothesis  lay dormant for a further 15 years until an italian group reported a series of experiments in which they used monoclonal antibodies against tg that identified intact tg in the retro - orbital tissue from three patients with go by western blotting and elisa.18 they did not find tg and anti - tg immune complexes in the orbit and concluded that autoimmunity against tg was probably a factor in the development of ophthalmopathy but likely cell mediated .\na year later the same group carried out additional studies in more patients with go , again identifying intact tg in fibroadipose tissue from three of seven patients by immunoprecipitation and western blotting with tg monoclonal antibodies .\nthey did not detect tg in eom extracts , similar to our own earlier findings in which eye muscle membranes did not react with our tg monoclonal antibodies.19 they also demonstrated intact tg in sub - palpebral skin extracts from two of two patients with go and they suggested that we should re - visit the kriss hypothesis and the possibility that tg is an important target for the autoimmune reactions in ophthalmopathy.19 on the other hand , kendall - taylor et al20 identified an igg which they called  ophthalmopathic immunoglobulin  that bound to retro - orbital but not to thyroid membranes , thyroid microsomes , or tg .\nthey concluded that go was associated with what they called a  specific ophthalmopathic immunoglobulin  that reacted with retro - orbital antigen , as distinct from thyroid antigens , suggesting that the ophthalmopathy was an entity distinct from autoimmune thyroid disease .\nvery recently , we demonstrated a significant positive correlation between serum tg levels and the presence and severity of ophthalmopathy in patients with graves disease.21 in patients with graves disease , but not hashimoto thyroiditis , tg levels also correlated with serum titers of tshr antibodies , favoring the notion that not only tshr but also tg , may be released from the thyroid gland in the course of a thyroiditis and home to the orbit where they become targets of autoantibodies and cytotoxic t lymphocytes .\nsmith,22 smith et al,23 fernando et al,24,25 and smith et al26 have convincingly demonstrated that orbital fibroblasts from patients with go respond differently to skin fibroblasts and orbital fibroblasts from normal subjects in vitro .\nhowever , the fibroblasts may actually be the same in all situations but different in go only because they have been primed in the context of the orbital reaction and have new surface markers which makes them seem different , ie , we need to differentiate between cause and effect before promoting the go orbital fibroblasts , preadipocytes , and fibrocytes as  unique \n. however , if considered in this light , the results described by smith et al23 are compatible with , and supportive of , the  thyroid antigen hypothesis  .\nwhile an effect of cytotoxic antibodies targeting tg bound to eom cells or orbital fibroblasts is one possible mechanism for the initialization of orbital inflammation , there are other potential mechanisms for reactivity against tg ( and other thyroid antigens ) in situ in the orbit .\nwhile it is known that orbital fibroblasts can be stimulated by tshr antibodies in vitro,27 suggesting that the prominent orbital scarring and glycosaminoglycans overproduction28,29 of go is due to a reaction with the tshr , this could also result from a reaction between tg antibodies and tg attached to the orbital fibroblasts ; more likely , both mechanisms contribute to the orbital pathology and clinical features ( table 1 ) .\nsubacute thyroiditis30 and radioiodine treatment of graves hyperthyroidism may be good models for what may happen to the orbit in patients with thyroiditis .\nwhat happens to the thyroid gland following radioactive iodine treatment of patients with graves hyperthyroidism .\nfollowing i , there is a flare up in the thyroiditis with release of thyroid proteins and increased production of the corresponding antibodies , against tg , tpo , and the tshr.31,32 in addition , we have recently shown an increase in serum tg concentrations following radioiodine which correlated with an increase in tshr antibody titer , initial worsening of the eye signs , but later improvement ( wall et al , 2013 , unpublished observations ) .\nit is also likely , but not yet shown , that the numbers of thyroid antigen - sensitized t cells increase in the thyroid following i treatment ; antibodies and sensitized t cells could pass to the orbital tissues , leading to a flare up in the severity of existing eye disease .\nindeed , studies confirming that radioactive iodine treatment leads to worsening of eye signs  or even the new development of ophthalmopathy , although this is more controversial  would be good evidence for a role of autoimmunity against thyroid antigens in the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with thyroid autoimmunity.33,34 while there is no mechanistic data that radioactive iodine worsens go by increasing thyroid destruction , release of tg , and production of tg \/ anti - tg immune complex , this is our working hypothesis for present in vitro and clinical studies ( table 2 ) . in the longer term , one would expect a decrease in the severity of the ophthalmopathy as the  thyroid antigen mass  is destroyed by i , and this has been shown in earlier observations that total thyroidectomy is associated with the improvement of existing eye disease and prevention of new ophthalmopathy.3537 while this review focuses on the role of tg , we believe that there are other thyroid antigens that are involved in the pathogenic process of go .\nthis process can be characterized as a complex series of reactions involving multiple thyroid antigens , the corresponding serum autoantibodies , cellular immunity , cytokines , and a large number of other chemical mediators and co - factors .\nour proposed hypothesis for the role of tg in the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with thyroid autoimmunity is shown schematically in figure 1 .\nthe importance of chemokines such as cxcl10 and ccl2 on go has been investigated by the italian team.38,39 in their in vivo and in vitro studies , they have demonstrated that eom involves in the self - perpetuation of inflammation by secreting cxcl10 and ccl2 chemokines under the influence of cytokines especially ifn. in addition to that , cxcl9 and cxcl10 have been assessed as surrogate markers of go while patients undergoing treatment and were proposed to be useful guidelines in therapeutic decision - making.40\nthe evidence for a role of autoimmunity against tg is , as is the case for the tshr , mainly circumstantial . in order to prove the  thyroid antigen hypothesis  , we must demonstrate that normal orbital fibroblasts and eom cells , to which are attached tg , become targets for antibodies and\/or sensitized t lymphocytes from patients with ophthalmopathy , but not from those without eye disease .\nwe can compare go patient sera vs normal sera , fibroblasts to which is bound tg vs control antigen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells , or purified t - cell subsets from patients with go vs those from patients with graves disease without eye signs .\nwe can also isolate mononuclear cells from the thyroid of patients with go and test for reactivity against the same target cells vs mononuclear cells from patients with graves disease without ophthalmopathy .\nspecific igg autoantibodies obtained by affinity chromatography , and purified subpopulations of t cells targeting tg can be incubated with tg - coated eom cells or orbital fibroblasts to confirm findings using serum and unfractionated mononuclear cells . as end points\nit is also possible to study the putative benefits of selenium supplementation in go in this model\n. we can carry out serial studies of patients with graves hyperthyroidism , measuring serum tg antibodies and correlating with eye signs .\nthe notion that tg antibodies tend to be low in patients with ophthalmopathy and those without eye disease due to their absorption by the orbital tissues can be studied by correlating orbital tg levels in immunohistochemistry with parameters of the orbital autoimmune reactions , scores for eye signs , and serum tg and anti - tg titers in serial studies of patients with and without ophthalmopathy , including those treated with radioactive iodine .\nthe orbital reactions in patients with graves disease are complex , involving antibodies and t lymphocytes , as well as other mononuclear cells , homing receptors on orbital cells , and cytokines .\nmoreover , we must determine why it is that only approximately 50% of patients with graves hyperthyroidism develop ophthalmopathy .\nenvironmental and genetic factors will play a role , an example being the presence of a recently shown informative single nucleotide polymorphism in the casq1 gene which is linked to ophthalmopathy.41 smoking is well recognized as a major risk factor for ophthalmopathy and stress is likely to play an important role in its initiation.42 in conclusion , it does seem appropriate to give serious attention to the possibility that the pathogenesis of go is not just about the tshr but the contribution from tg and other thyroid antigens as well .","abstract":" while most authors believe that autoimmunity against the tsh receptor expressed in the orbital connective tissue cells is the main reaction that leads to the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with graves hyperthyroidism , an older hypothesis that deserves fresh consideration is based on the notion that thyroglobulin ( tg ) in the thyroid gland passes in a retrograde fashion to the orbit where it is recognized by tg autoantibodies , leading to inflammation . here \n , we review new evidence that supports a role of tg and propose a new hypothesis based on the notion that tg is targeted in the orbit leading to a complex cascade of reactions that leads to graves ophthalmopathy .

Respiratory physiotherapy is also one of the basic therapies for \n patients who have had tracheal stenosis and lung transplant. \n\nBecause the physiotherapist working in the respiratory physiotherapy group does not \nneed to be a specialist, it is possible to provide therapy to patients throughout the \nmedical system with minimal additional expense3,4). The therapy of respiratory physiotherapy is effective not only for those with \n neuromuscular disease (NMD) or sports injuries but also in preventing or \n alleviating shortness of breath and dyspnea. In addition, respiratory \nphysiotherapy can provide education to patients and families (to learn how to \n maintain the function of the respiratory system) and promote the patient's \nquality of life (QOL), which is not a trivial problem when considering the costs \n of drugs, operation, and hospitalization that are related to the respiratory \nsystem. \n\nThe respiratory physiotherapy group can use their own skills, which are not \n completely related to the respiratory physiotherapy group, such as exercise \n therapist \/ therapist and respiratory therapist \/ respiratory therapist, to treat \nthe respiratory system. At present, there are three physiotherapists \nregistered as respiratory physiotherapists in Korea, and \nthere have been seminars to learn from \nforeign countries. \n\nBecause the respiratory physiotherapy group is not yet widely utilized in \n Korea, research on this field is important. The primary purpose of this study is \n to identify effective intervention methods to improve the QOL and exercise ability \n of patients with NMD. \n\nThe secondary purpose of this study is to determine which rehabilitation program \nis more suitable for the respiratory physiotherapy group in the management of the \nrespiratory system of patients with NMD. \n\nThis study was designed to examine the effects of two different respiratory \nphysiotherapy interventions using pulmonary rehabilitation and physiotherapy \ngroup on the QOL of patients with NMD.

maximum recommended dose was 20  mg per day for patients with hepatic impairment , age greater than 60  years , cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) 2c19 poor metabolizers , or patients taking concomitant cyp2c19 inhibitors , such as cimetidine .\nit was further noted that citalopram should not be used in patients with congenital long qt syndrome ( lqts ) .\nelectrocardiographic monitoring was recommended if citalopram is used in patients with congestive heart failure , bradyarrhythmias , predisposition to hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia , or in combination with other qt - prolonging drugs .\nthe 44-year - old patient , who was a non - smoker and rarely consumed small amounts of alcohol , had taken citalopram 40  mg per day for mild depression since before july 2009 . at that time\n, she was also taking bupropion ( wellbutrin ) 200  mg per day . likewise , since before july 2009 she had taken nadolol 40  mg \/ day for mild hypertension that was well controlled . in july 2009\nshe was prescribed divalproex ( depakote extended release [ er ] ) 250  mg \/ day , the dosage of which was increased to 500  mg per day in 2010 and increased again to 1000  mg per day in january 2011 . at that time\nthe latter two medications were given for frequent migraine headaches . in january 2011 , bupropion was discontinued when the dosage of citalopram was increased from 40 to 60  mg per day . on 5 may 2011 ,\naspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) was 146 ( range 635 u \/ l ) and alkaline phosphatase ( alk phos ) was 118 ( range 30125 u \/ l ) .\nrepeat testing on 8 may 2011 found ast at 75 , alk phos at 210 , and alanine transaminase ( alt ) at 172 ( range 840 u \/ l ) . at that time , the meloxicam dosage was discontinued .\nhowever , divalproex was continued at 1000  mg per day and citalopram at 60  mg per day .\nno further liver function tests were performed , and no electrocardiogram testing or therapeutic drug monitoring was performed in 2011 .\nthe patient was a certified scuba diver , although she had not been diving for over a year when , in december 2011 , she arranged to dive in a tropical location while on a family vacation . while diving with a small group of scuba divers led by a qualified guide , the patient  developed problems  during the initial descent to a depth of about 40 feet .\nthe guide immediately took her to the surface and she was placed on the deck of the nearest dive boat  a boat equipped with an automatic defibrillator .\nalthough no permanent recording exists , the patient s rhythm changed from apparent torsade de pointes ( tdp ) to ventricular fibrillation , and defibrillation was not successful .\nautopsy performed the next day by the local medical examiner revealed an obese ( body mass index [ bmi ] ~36 ) caucasian body with pulmonary congestion and edema , hepatic congestion , splenic congestion , and cardiomegaly .\nmicroscopic examination revealed interstitial myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as an isolated liver granuloma .\nthe post mortem blood concentration of citalopram was reported at 1300  ng \/ ml , well above the therapeutic level .\nin addition , analysis of post mortem blood resulted in the following findings : ethanol 35  mg \/ dl , ibuprofen 10 mcg \/ ml , and caffeine positive but not quantified .\nwhile a high level of caffeine might have contributed to the fatal outcome , it seems unlikely since caffeine is routinely \npositive in the blood of those who consume beverages containing caffeine . in view of the  slightly enlarged heart  and level of citalopram , and in the absence of other relevant findings , the medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was a fatal cardiac arrhythmia .\nfor ease of comparison , the blood levels of citalopram reported by various authors are expressed as ng \/ ml or ng \/ mg .\nthe ratio of plasma to whole blood concentration of citalopram is 0.74    0.04 .\nthus , the blood concentration of 1300  ng \/ ml is equivalent to a plasma level of approximately 962  ng \/ ml . citalopram therapeutic and comatose - fatal plasma concentrations are reported to be 5110 and 50006000  ng \/ ml , respectively .\nthus , although the level of citalopram in the patient s post mortem blood was substantially above the therapeutic range , it was not an obvious cause of death , per se .\nit was much higher than would be predicted if the patient had normal metabolism of citalopram , even at the dosage of 60  mg per day .\nfurthermore , why did the patient die only after approximately 11  months of such high dosage ?\none possible explanation for a high level of citalopram and death might be an acute overdose ; possibly suicidal . however , there is no evidence that the patient was suicidal , and family members were confident that she was happily enjoying a vacation . also inconsistent with acute overdose is the fact that additional toxicology analysis in a different laboratory resulted in a blood level of citalopram of 1426  ng \/ ml and a level of desmethylcitalopram of 846  ng \/ ml . in patients chronically taking citalopram , the levels\nare typically three to four times higher than the metabolite , desmethylcitalopram . in acute overdose\n, the ratio of the parent drug to metabolite would be higher . in this patient ,\nthe ratio of parent drug to metabolite was lower than expected and is inconsistent with acute overdose . compared with citalopram ,\nthe relatively high level of the metabolite that is normally eliminated mainly by cyp2d6 supported the speculation that the deceased might have been a poor metabolizer via 2d6 .\nsubsequent testing of post mortem blood indicated that , genotypically , she was an intermediate metabolizer via 2d6 . in any event\n, acute overdose , suicidal or accidental , was not the cause of the high level of citalopram and its metabolite in this patient at the time of her death .\nmetabolism of citalopram to desmethylcitalopram is carried out mainly by cyp2c19 . in turn , the metabolism of desmethylcitalopram to didesmethylcitalopram is carried out mainly by cyp2d6\n. while about 7  % of caucasians are poor metabolizers via 2d6 , only about 3  % are poor metabolizers via 2c19 .\nthe probability that a person would be a poor metabolizer via both pathways is very low , although such cases have been reported [ 46 ] .\nthe patient in this case was found to be a genotypically normal metabolizer via cyp2c19 and an intermediate metabolizer via cyp2d6 .\nthe question thus arose regarding the post mortem blood level of citalopram of approximately 13001400  ng \/ ml .\nhow did the level get so high , and was citalopram the cause of the patient s death ?\npost mortem redistribution did not account for the high level of citalopram in the patient s blood . because the autopsy was performed the morning after death\n, there was little time for redistribution . while some antidepressants show substantial post mortem increases in blood concentration , citalopram increased by only 25  % , even after 6.4  days post mortem .\nmany drugs are inhibitors of one or more cyp isoforms , but such classical drug interactions were not apparent in this case . on the other hand , low activity of cyp2c19 and\/or cyp2d6 ( especially and ) as caused by a poorly functioning liver , would promote the accumulation of citalopram and desmethylcitalopram to higher than expected levels [ 8 , 9 ] .\nirrespective of her genetic background , it is apparent that the patient in this case became a poor metabolizer phenotypically via both 2c19 and 2d6 .\nboth drugs have warnings regarding liver dysfunction ; the latter with a prominent black box warning .\nmeloxicam was discontinued when the patient s liver enzymes were found to be elevated in may of 2011 .\ndivalproex , the dose of which had been increased from 500  mg per day to 1000  mg per day in january of 2011 , was continued to the time of her death . at autopsy ,\nher liver did not show gross anatomical defects , but impaired function of cyp enzymes would not be apparent .\nmild to moderate liver disease is associated with a 77  % decrease in the clearance of mephenytoin ( cyp2c19 ) [ 8 , 10 ] .\nessentially , all cyp enzymes are inhibited in later stages of liver disease , with a 28  % decrease in the clearance of dapsone ( cyp3a4 ) and a 4  % decrease in clearance of debrisoquine ( cyp2d6 ) . the fact that mild to moderate liver disease selectively and profoundly inhibits cyp2c19 , but barely inhibits cyp2d6 , is nevertheless consistent with the relatively high level of desmethylcitalopram found in post mortem blood because the patient inherited intermediate metabolism via cyp2d6 . as noted above , no liver function or tests\nwere carried out after may 2011 , and no determination of citalopram levels was ever performed .\nalthough we can not rule out other explanations , based on the scant but abnormal liver function tests in may 2011 , as well the continued application of divalproex , we suggest that impaired metabolism caused accumulation of citalopram in this patient .\nno electrocardiogram was performed during 2011 ; thus , we are also uncertain of the extent of qt prolongation caused by the high level of citalopram . even in the absence of measured levels of the drug\n, it is evident that impaired metabolism of citalopram and its metabolite were present in this patient .\nmost likely , accumulation of citalopram to such a high level occurred slowly during 2011 .\nthe post mortem blood level of 1300  ng \/ ml ( equivalent to a plasma level of 962  ng \/ ml   was thus about nine times the upper limit of the therapeutic plasma level range ( 5110  ng \/ ml ) but less than that usually associated with death ( 50006000  ng \/ ml ) . in cases in which citalopram was judged to be the cause of death , concentrations ranged from 2000 to 6200  ng \/ mg whole blood .\nthe specific density of blood is approximately 1.04 at 25  c ; thus , concentrations expressed as ng \/ mg\ntoxic concentrations of citalopram in autopsy cases ( most were accidental death ) ranged from 400 to 900  ng \/ mg whole blood . in living individuals ( mostly traffic violations ) citalopram concentrations ranged from 0.0 to 300  ng \/ mg .\nthe blood alcohol in these samples ranged from 0.0 to 3.1  mg \/ g ( ~310  mg \/ dl ) .\nsome individuals were alive with supratherapeutic concentrations of citalopram and , in many cases , very high levels of alcohol .\ntherefore , alcohol does not necessarily increase citalopram mortality and moderately supratherapeutic concentrations of citalopram do not increase alcohol mortality .\nhowever , the authors speculated that  lower concentrations [ of citalopram ] may cause death if combined with the intake of high concentrations of alcohol .\n the low level of alcohol ( 35  mg \/ dl ) in the post mortem blood of the patient in this case may or may not have contributed to the outcome . in 13 cases examined forensically ,\ncitalopram was not judged to be the underlying cause of death , but only an \nthe authors concluded ,  there is a large apparent therapeutic index with postmortem concentrations in blood possibly ranging as least as high as 1300  ng \/ ml compared to its therapeutic concentration of approximately 200  ng \/ ml  .\nsome other individuals survived levels of citalopram ranging from 90 to 1640  ng \/ ml in post mortem blood only to die of what were judged to be other causes .\nthese observations may help explain how , in the case reported here , the patient survived for nearly a year as citalopram accumulated in her body to a concentration that was between therapeutic and a more patently fatal concentration .\nthey also raise the questions of the effect of citalopram on the qt interval and why she died while scuba diving .\ncitalopram , like a number of drugs listed on crediblemeds ( http:\/\/www.crediblemeds.org ) , is known to cause prolonged qt . the official labeling for celexa ( citalopram ) includes the following :  citalopram causes dose - dependent qtc prolongation , an ecg abnormality that has been associated with torsade de pointes ( tdp ) , ventricular tachycardia , and sudden death , all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram .   citalopram causes dose - dependent qtc prolongation , an ecg abnormality that has been associated with torsade de pointes ( tdp ) , ventricular tachycardia , and sudden death , all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram . \nthe risk of a fatal outcome as a consequence of drug - induced long qt syndrome ( dilqts ) and tdp is substantial [ 15 , 16 ] .\nqtc is linearly dependent on the predicted citalopram plasma concentration , with a slope of 40  ms per mg per liter of citalopram  with a between - subject coefficient of variation of 70  % .\nif that average value were applied in this case , then the predicted increase in qtc would be 38  ms .\nwide inter - individual variability precludes precise prediction and the rr interval has a large effect on qt that would be additive to the effects of citalopram in this case .\nit is unlikely that the low concentration of alcohol in this patient contributed to qt prolongation that is observed with moderate and high levels of alcohol [ 18 , 19 ] .\nfound a close relationship between the qtc and serum level as citalopram was eliminated from the body following an acute overdosage . at the initial serum level of 1200  ng \/ ml\n, equivalent to 1620  ng \/ l blood level , the qtc was approximately 540  ms . when the drug was finally eliminated , the qtc was 430  ms . at a blood level of 1300  ng\n\/ ml , as in the case described here , the best fit curve predicts a qtc ( bazett ) of about 497  ms .\nindividuals with genetically determined lqts are particularly at risk for further increases in the qt interval when the dive reflex is initiated .\nfacial immersion in water causes greater increases in qt interval in children with non - familial lqts , and nearly 30  % of swimming - related drowning cases that were referred to tester et al\nmany such drownings occur in lqts children because their risk of a fatal cardiac arrhythmia is significantly increased when the dive reflex is elicited .\ncatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( cpvt ) , a condition that mimics lqts in some ways , is also associated with drowning or near drowning .\nthe mammalian dive reflex involves concurrent sympathetic and parasympathetic activation   and parasympathetically mediated bradycardia . in addition , the  cold shock response involves sympathetically mediated tachycardia .\nvarious conduction abnormalities , with individual differences , are observed when a subject s face is immersed in water .\nautonomic conflict and abnormal cardiac rhythms may arise when parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the nervous system innervating the heart are simultaneously activated . the fda warning concerning citalopram and prolonged qt specifically mentions bradyarrhythmias .\nthe bradycardia and autonomic conflict associated with scuba diving is a potential trigger for sudden death in a person with a prolonged qt interval .\nother contributing factors may have included hypoxia caused by breath holding while equilibrating to depth . in the case described here , dilqts caused by a high level of citalopram , which in turn was related to excessive dosage and poor metabolism , may have set the patient up for a fatal cardiac arrhythmia while diving .\nin light of the occurrence of sudden death ( i.e. , fatal cardiac rhythm ) in water of individuals with inherited lqts , it seems reasonable to suggest that , in general , dilqts is an independent risk factor for apparent drowning .\nit is well known that alcohol is the drug most commonly associated with drowning [ 27 , 28 ] .\nwhat is not commonly appreciated is that moderate levels of alcohol induce prolonged qt and increased qt dispersion [ 18 , 19 ] .\nthe question arises whether alcohol - associated drowning in any particular case is due to psychomotor impairment and\/or to a fatal cardiac arrhythmia .\npreliminary data , to be published separately , suggest an association of citalopram with drowning .\nthe case reported here is an example of a fatal outcome when prolonged qt interval was combined with the autonomic conflict of the mammalian dive reflex .","abstract":" while scuba diving , a 44-year - old caucasian patient had an abnormal

{"article":"depression is one of the most common mental health problems and is a significant cause of morbidity .\ndepression interferes with daily functioning and quality of life and places significant burden on the health care system.1 depression is also an important risk factor for suicide.2 many factors contribute to the etiology of depression , including stressful life events,3,4 medical treatments , nonpsychiatric illnesses , such as neurological conditions,5 stroke,6 diabetes,7 and cancer,8 and psychological factors .\nrecent studies have demonstrated an association between air pollution and depressive symptoms in humans.918 gaseous ambient air pollutants such as ozone are known to behave as harmful agents.19 fine particulate matter are associated with increased mortality due to respiratory disease , heart disease , and stroke.20 ozone exposure is known to affect health19,2128 and is mainly a risk factor for respiratory conditions such as asthma.2931 several studies have also linked ambient ozone to nonrespiratory conditions such as cardiac disease,31,32 appendicitis,33 headaches and migraines,34 and skin conditions.3539 moreover , because of its oxidative properties , ozone may induce oxidative stress , affecting the central nervous system ( cns ) , which is a potential cause of depression.40 indeed , some studies have demonstrated links between ozone levels and depression9,10,16 and suicide attempts.11,40,41 a study conducted in edmonton , canada , suggested that emergency department ( ed ) visits for depression are associated with exposure to ambient air pollution.9 this time series study analyzed 15,556 ed visits for depression between 1992 and 2002 . in another canadian study , a hierarchical clusters design was used to examine 27,047 ed visits for depression in 6 canadian cities .\nresults showed a correlation between ed visits for depression and ambient air pollution , most of which results from the combustion of fossil fuels , such as from motor vehicles.10 a study of 537 participants in seoul , korea , reported that an increase in ambient air pollution , specifically pm2.5 , no2 , and o3 , was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms among elderly adults .\nthese results add to the growing body of literature , suggesting an association between ambient air pollution and emotional symptoms.16 suicide attempts as a result of depression have also been linked to air pollution exposure . in a study in vancouver , canada , ambient air pollution\nwas associated with ed visits for suicide attempts.11 a study in taipei city , taiwan , examined 4,857 deaths by suicide , demonstrating a temporal relation between suicide and air pollution.41 results from several studies suggest that exposure to air pollutants may affect men and women differently.42 for example , sex hormones estradiol and testosterone are known to influence transportation and accumulation of toxic chemicals to the brain and other organs .\nit is not yet known how these sex differences might bear on depression and suicide risk.42 only limited number of studies have been reported on the relations between air pollution and depression , and most of these studies were done in a single city with small sample size .\nthis might be as a result of the fact that depression is not a conventional disease that has been biologically linked to air pollution .\nthe aim of this multicity study was to investigate the association between ambient air pollution , especially ozone exposure , and ed visits for depression during the period from april 2004 to december 2011 in nine urban areas across ontario , canada : algoma , halton , hamilton , london , ottawa , peel , toronto , windsor , and york .\nwe also examined the relations between air pollution exposure and risk of suicide attempts among patients admitted to the ed for depression .\nwe conducted this multicity study to see whether the results would

code starts with x6 ( suicide by cause of poisoning ) , x7 ( suicide by cause of hanging , strangulation , suffocation , drowning , cutting , and\/or piercing with sharp object ) , or x80 - 3 ( suicide by cause of jumping from a high place , jumping , or lying before a moving object ) . because of the small sample size of this study , we considered both genders for all the cities together ( n = 4,131 patients ; 67% females , 33% males ) .\nthe highest frequency occurred at the age of 19 years among both females ( 4.63% ) and males ( 3.59% ) .\nanalyses did not reveal a significant association between exposure to air pollutants and risk of suicide attempts .\nrandom - effects estimates allow the possibility that the estimates from different cities may be estimates of different parameters . results of a q - statistic test indicated that for the majority of estimates ( 92% ) , the fixed - effects model was a good fit for the data .\neffects were calculated using random -

.\nanalyses did not reveal a significant association between exposure to air pollutants and risk of suicide attempts .\nthis study investigated the effect of short - term exposure to ambient air pollution on ed visits for depression . to this end , we examined records from 118,602 ed visits for depression by patients across nine major urban areas in the province of ontario , canada . to our knowledge , this is among the largest multisite studies of ed visits for depression .\nmultisite studies have the advantage of generating more reliable results and tend to be less vulnerable to bias when compared to small studies conducted at individual centers.48 overall , results indicated that short - term exposure to increased levels of several common pollutants is significantly associated with increased risk of an ed visit for depression .\nseveral studies suggest that outdoor air pollution , especially ozone , particulate matter , and carbon monoxide may have a significant impact on cns health and disease.4952 ozone , because of its oxidative properties , may induce oxidative stress in the cns , which is a potential cause of depression.40 several previous studies have linked ozone levels to depression9,10,16,53 and suicide attempts.11,40,41 in this study , higher ozone levels were associated with increased risk of hospital visits for depression , for both males and females , at multiple time points within the eight days immediately following exposure .\nthe effect of ozone seemed more pronounced during the warm months ( april  september ) than the cold months ( october  march ) .\nthese results are supported by previously published studies of the effects of ozone on depression.9,10,16 the levels of ozone are also higher in warm seasons .\nresults of the current study also suggest an association between ed visits for depression and levels of pm2.5 , no2 , and so2 . there is a growing body of literature linking depression with exposure to air pollution .\na large epidemiological study of 15,556 ed visits in edmonton , canada , found similar evidence for an association between ozone exposure and depression , reporting that higher daily ozone levels were associated with more ed visits for depression one day post exposure.9 this study also reported effects of increased levels of carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxide , sulfur dioxide , and airborne particulate matter on emergency visits for depression .\nsimilarly , a study of 537 participants in seoul , korea , reported that an increase in ambient air pollution , pm2.5 , no2 , and o3 may increase depressive symptoms among elderly adults .\nthese results support the hypothesis that ambient air pollution is associated with emotional symptoms . in further support of this hypothesis ,\nstudies using postmortem sampling have identified particulate matter in the human brain , albeit of unknown composition and origin.54 some authors have suggested that ambient particulate matter , such as that originating from diesel exhaust , may have toxic effects on dopaminergic neurons in the brain .\nthis neurotoxicity may be a result of oxidative stress and has been hypothesized to affect depressive moods.5557 other authors have suggested a link between air pollutant exposure and levels of serotonin,58 a neurotransmitter that has also been implicated in depression.59 rat studies have demonstrated a near immediate effect of exposure to ozone on metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin.60 it is not yet known whether ozone may contribute to imbalances in these neurotransmitters in humans .\nsuicide attempts as a result of depression have also been linked to air pollution exposure.11,40,41 in this study , we examined data from patients who in addition to a primary diagnosis of depression had also attempted suicide .\nwe did not find any significant associations between suicide attempt and exposure to the air pollutants studied .\nthese results are in contrast to results of other studies linking ambient air pollution to suicide risk.11,40,41 a study from vancouver , canada , showed a potential link between the effects of ambient air pollution on ed visits for suicide attempts.11 a study in middle franconia of 1,008 suicides and 917 suicide attempts from 2004 to 2007 reported that days on which two or more suicides occurred had higher ambient ozone levels than those days on which one or zero suicides were observed.40 this study also reported a seasonal effect on suicide , with higher than usual suicide rates observed from july to september , when ozone levels are typically highest . a study of 4,857 deaths by suicide in taipei city , taiwan , assessed the temporal relation between suicide and air pollution.41\nthe authors reported that higher levels of gaseous air pollutants such as o3 and so2 were associated with an increased risk of suicide at longer time delays .\ntheir findings also suggested a seasonal pattern of increased suicide occurring in early summer . a seasonal variation in suicide with a peak in march  april and august , respectively , and with a decrease in december \njanuary was also reported in belgium for the period 19791987.61 disparities in sampling strategies may contribute to the conflicting findings between studies .\nthe present study examined the link between exposure to air pollutants and suicide risk only among patients with an ed visit for depression .\nthe previously reported link between ambient air pollution and suicide may therefore be explained by the increased risk of depression conferred by exposure to pollutants .\nin addition , many studies reporting associations between air pollution exposure and suicide have not accounted for meteorological variables such as ambient temperature , which may explain the previously reported link between summer months and suicide risk.40 ozone levels tend to be higher on warmer days , and results of the present study suggest that the association between ozone levels and suicide is not statistically significant .\nsome authors have suggested that seasonal trends in suicide may be due in part to higher ambient temperatures during the summer months , rather than due to high ozone levels .\npsychological factors , such as aggression and impulsivity , may be influenced by higher temperatures and may account for increases in suicide risk in the summer months.62 however , results of the present study indicated that even when meteorological factors were controlled for , associations between ambient air pollution and ed visits for depression were more pronounced during the summer months .\nthis suggests that additional factors may be at play in the potentially complex relationship between season , air pollution , and depression .\nresults of this study suggest that ed visits for depression are associated with short - term exposure to ambient air pollutants and that this pattern of association differs for warm vs. cold months in canada .\nthe cases of depression assessed by this study were only those in which individuals sought ed treatment . presumably , these represent more severe depressive episodes , but future research assessing associations between pollutant exposure and depression in a community sample would lend more confidence to our conclusions .\nthe results from this study agree with the recently reported conclusions from observation in rodents that short - term exposure to ozone or particulate matter activates the stress response axis and increases stress hormone levels.63,64 efforts to reduce ozone levels in the atmosphere may mitigate ed presentations to eds for depressions .","abstract":" backgroundthe aim of this study was to investigate the associations between ambient air pollution and emergency department ( ed ) visits for depression.methodshealth data were retrieved from the national ambulatory care reporting system . \n ed visits for depression were retrieved from the national ambulatory care reporting system using the international classification of diseases ( icd-10 ) , tenth revision codes ; icd-10 : f32 ( mild depressive episode ) and icd-10 : f33 ( recurrent depressive disorder ) . a case - crossover design was employed for this study . \n conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios.resultsfor females , exposure to ozone was associated with increased risk of an ed visit for depression between 1 and 7 days after exposure , for males , between 1 and 5 , and 8 days after exposure , with odds ratios ranging between 1.02 and 1.03.conclusionsthese findings suggest that , as hypothesized , there is a positive association between exposure to air pollution and ed visits for depression .
